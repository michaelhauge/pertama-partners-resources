## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Employee forgot master password for password manager
**Solution**:
- Recovery process: [Describe your password manager's recovery process]
- Prevention: Ensure employee writes down master password and stores securely (not digitally)

### Issue: MFA setup failing (not receiving codes)
**Solution**:
- Check phone number is correct (international format: +65... for Singapore)
- Try authenticator app instead of SMS
- Use backup codes stored in password manager

### Issue: VPN not connecting
**Solution**:
- Check credentials are correct
- Verify VPN server address
- Test on different network (coffee shop vs. home)
- Check firewall settings on device

### Issue: Employee doesn't have smartphone for MFA
**Solution**:
- Provide hardware security key (YubiKey, $50 per key)
- OR allow SMS to landline (phone call instead of text)
- OR use desktop authenticator app (less secure, but better than no MFA)

### Issue: BYOD device too old for MDM enrollment
**Solution**:
- Require device upgrade (employee responsibility)
- OR provide company device
- OR restrict BYOD to email-only access (no sensitive data)
