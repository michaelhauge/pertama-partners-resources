## Notes for Incident Responders

### Best Practices for Incident Documentation

1. **Document immediately**: Don't wait - memories fade, logs get overwritten
2. **Be specific**: "Around 2pm" → "14:15 SGT"; "some credentials" → "AWS production keys"
3. **Stick to facts**: Separate observations from speculation
4. **Preserve evidence**: Screenshot everything before deleting/removing
5. **Update as you learn**: This is a living document during active incidents
6. **Maintain confidentiality**: Incident reports contain sensitive data

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Deleting the threat before documenting** (screenshot first!)
❌ **Rotating credentials without documenting which ones** (you'll forget)
❌ **Assuming timeline without checking logs** (memories are unreliable)
❌ **Closing incident before corrective actions complete** (track to completion)
❌ **Not notifying legal/compliance early** (they need time to assess)

### When to Escalate

**Escalate to executive team if**:
- Customer PII exposure >100 records
- Financial impact >$10,000
- Media attention or public disclosure
- Regulatory notification required
- Customer contracts violated

**Escalate to legal immediately if**:
- Regulatory notification deadline approaching
- Customer litigation risk
- Law enforcement involvement needed
- Contractual breach suspected

### Incident Report Storage

**Where to store completed reports**:
- Secure folder with restricted access (not general file share)
- Encrypted if containing sensitive data
- Retention: 3-7 years (check local compliance requirements)
- Backed up regularly

**Access control**:
- Only incident response team, security, legal, executives
- Audit access to incident reports
- Never email full reports (use secure file sharing)

### Follow-Up Actions

After closing an incident:
- [ ] Schedule lessons learned meeting (within 1 week)
- [ ] Update security policies based on findings
- [ ] Track corrective actions to completion (monthly review)
- [ ] Share anonymized case study with team (for learning)
- [ ] Update incident response runbook if needed
