## Section 4: Data Classification & Handling

### 4.1 Data Classification Levels

[COMPANY NAME] classifies data into four levels. **Know what you're sharing before using AI.**

| Level | Examples | AI Tool Policy |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Public** | Published blog posts, marketing materials, public product specs | ✅ OK to share with any approved AI tool |
| **Internal** | Internal processes, meeting notes (non-sensitive), draft documents | ✅ OK with approved enterprise AI tools only |
| **Confidential** | Customer PII, contracts, financials, unreleased product plans | ⚠️ Anonymize before sharing, or use only DPA-backed enterprise AI |
| **Secret** | API keys, passwords, credentials, trade secrets, M&A plans | ❌ **NEVER share with AI tools** |

### 4.2 Specific Examples for [COMPANY NAME]

**Public** (safe for any approved AI):
- [ ] Example: [Published blog posts on our website]
- [ ] Example: [Public product documentation]
- [ ] Example: [Marketing copy for social media]
- [ ] Other: ____________________________________________________________

**Internal** (enterprise AI only):
- [ ] Example: [Internal wiki articles]
- [ ] Example: [Team meeting notes without customer details]
- [ ] Example: [Draft proposals without pricing]
- [ ] Other: ____________________________________________________________

**Confidential** (anonymize first or DPA-required):
- [ ] Example: [Customer contracts with names/emails]
- [ ] Example: [Sales pipeline data]
- [ ] Example: [Financial reports]
- [ ] Example: [Employee performance reviews]
- [ ] Other: ____________________________________________________________

**Secret** (NEVER in AI):
- [ ] Example: [Production database credentials]
- [ ] Example: [AWS/GCP API keys]
- [ ] Example: [Source code for proprietary algorithms]
- [ ] Example: [M&A target company names]
- [ ] Other: ____________________________________________________________

### 4.3 Anonymization Requirements

When sharing Confidential data with AI tools, **anonymize first**:

**Remove or redact**:
- [ ] Names (replace with "[NAME]" or "Customer A")
- [ ] Email addresses
- [ ] Phone numbers
- [ ] Account IDs, usernames
- [ ] IP addresses
- [ ] Financial amounts (or round to ranges: "$100k-$500k")
- [ ] Dates (or make relative: "Q3 2025" → "last quarter")
- [ ] Geographic identifiers (cities, addresses)

**Example of proper anonymization**:
```
❌ BAD (raw Confidential data):
"Customer john.smith@acmecorp.com in Singapore signed a $450,000 annual contract
for our Enterprise plan on Jan 15, 2026. He complained about pricing."

✅ GOOD (anonymized):
"Enterprise customer in APAC region signed ~$400k-$500k annual contract recently.
Feedback indicated pricing concerns during negotiation."
```

## Section 6: Employee Responsibilities

### 6.1 Before Using AI

**Every time you use an AI tool for work, ask yourself**:
1. Is this tool on the approved list? (Section 3.1)
2. What data classification level am I sharing? (Section 4.1)
3. Am I following the data handling rules for that level? (Section 4.2)
4. Do I need to anonymize this data first? (Section 4.3)
5. Is this use case prohibited? (Section 5)

**If uncertain**: Don't use the tool. Ask your manager or IT/Security team first.

### 6.2 Account Hygiene

- [ ] **Use company accounts only** (not personal ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] **Enable MFA** on AI tool accounts

### 6.3 Accuracy & Verification

**You are responsible for AI output accuracy.**

- [ ] **Review all AI-generated content** before using in deliverables
- [ ] **Fact-check AI claims** (AI hallucinates - verify facts, statistics, citations)
- [ ] **Test AI-generated code** (don't trust it blindly)
- [ ] **Disclose AI use** when required (client contracts, academic work, regulated industries)

### 6.4 Prompt Hygiene

**Craft prompts carefully**:
- [ ] Don't paste entire files into AI if they contain secrets (check first)
- [ ] Don't include credentials in example code shared with AI
- [ ] Don't use customer names in prompts (anonymize)
- [ ] Be aware that prompts may be logged or reviewed

## Notes for Policy Administrators

### Customization Checklist

Before distributing this policy:
- [ ] Replace all [COMPANY NAME] placeholders
- [ ] Fill in approved tools list (Section 3.1)
- [ ] Add company-specific data classification examples (Section 4.2)
- [ ] Set approval process contacts and timelines (Section 3.2)

- [ ] Create employee training materials (Section 7.2)
- [ ] Set up incident reporting channels (Section 8.2)

### Rollout Recommendations

1. **Soft launch** (Week 1): Share policy with managers/leadership for feedback
2. **Training** (Week 2-3): Conduct AI security training for all employees
3. **Acknowledgment** (Week 4): Require signed acknowledgment from all employees
4. **Enforcement begins** (Week 5): Policy is now active
5. **First review** (Month 3): Assess policy effectiveness, gather feedback, update

### Common Questions to Prepare For

**Q: Can I use ChatGPT Free for work?**
A: No, only ChatGPT Team (company account) is approved. Free tier doesn't have DPA or business protections.

**Q: What if I already installed a skill before this policy?**
A: Submit it for retroactive approval (Section 3.2). If rejected, uninstall it.

**Q: Can I use AI for personal tasks on my work laptop?**
A: Personal use on company devices should follow company device policy. If using personal AI accounts, never paste work data.

**Q: What if a customer asks if we used AI?**
A: Be honest. "We used AI tools to assist with [task], but all work was reviewed and verified by our team."

### Metrics to Track

Monitor policy effectiveness:
- Number of AI tool approval requests per month
- Number of incidents reported per quarter
- Employee training completion rate
- Policy violations (by severity)
- Time to resolve approval requests (aim for <5 business days)
