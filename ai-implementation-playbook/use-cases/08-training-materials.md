## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create SOP Template (60 minutes)

**Standard Operating Procedure Template**:
```
Create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for: [PROCESS NAME]

Process overview:
- What: [WHAT IS THIS PROCESS]
- Who: [WHO PERFORMS THIS]
- When: [WHEN/HOW OFTEN]
- Why: [PURPOSE/GOAL]

Current process (explain how it's done now):
[DESCRIBE CURRENT PROCESS - can be messy notes from SME]

SOP should include:

1. **Title**: [Process Name] SOP

2. **Purpose**: (1-2 sentences) Why this process exists and what it achieves

3. **Scope**: Who this applies to, when to use

4. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - Who does what in this process
   - Approvals or sign-offs required

5. **Prerequisites**: What must be in place before starting

6. **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
   - Numbered steps (use action verbs: "Open," "Click," "Verify")
   - Sub-steps if needed (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
   - Screenshots placeholders: [SCREENSHOT: Description of what to show]
   - Decision points: "If X, then Y. If Z, then A."

7. **Quality Checks**: How to verify it was done correctly

8. **Common Issues and Solutions**:
   - What can go wrong
   - How to fix it

9. **Related Documents**: Links to related SOPs, policies, or tools

10. **Revision History**: Version, date, changes, author

Format:
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists
- Tables for complex decision trees
- Clear headings and sub-headings

Length: 800-1,200 words
Tone: Clear, direct, instructional (like IKEA assembly instructions)
```

### Step 2: Create Onboarding Checklist Template (45 minutes)

**Onboarding Checklist Template**:
```
Create an onboarding checklist for new [ROLE - e.g., Sales Reps, Engineers]:

Role: [JOB TITLE]
Department: [DEPARTMENT]
Onboarding duration: [E.G., 30 days, 90 days]

What they need to learn:
1. [TOPIC 1 - e.g., Company culture and values]
2. [TOPIC 2 - e.g., Product overview and positioning]
3. [TOPIC 3 - e.g., Tools and systems]
4. [TOPIC 4 - e.g., Department processes]
5. [TOPIC 5 - e.g., Role-specific skills]

Create a checklist organized by timeframe:

**Week 1: Getting Started**
- [ ] Day 1: [Task with owner - e.g., "Complete HR paperwork (with HR)"]
- [ ] Day 1-2: [Task]
- [ ] By end of Week 1: [Task]

**Week 2: [THEME - e.g., Product Training]**
- [ ] [Task]
- [ ] [Task]

**Week 3-4: [THEME - e.g., Shadowing and Practice]**
- [ ] [Task]
- [ ] [Task]

For each task:
- Clear action (what to do)
- Owner (who helps or approves)
- Resource (where to find info - link, doc, person)
- Estimated time (if significant)

Include milestones:
- End of Week 1: Can navigate tools and systems
- End of Week 2: Understands product and positioning
- End of Week 4: Ready to [perform core job function independently]

Format: Checkbox list, printable or digital
Length: 30-50 tasks for 30-day onboarding
Tone: Welcoming, supportive, clear
```

---

### Step 3: Create Quiz Template (30 minutes)

**Training Quiz Template**:
```
Create a quiz to assess understanding of [TOPIC]:

Topic: [E.G., "Customer Support Best Practices"]
Audience: [E.G., "New customer support reps"]
What they should know: [LIST 3-5 KEY CONCEPTS]

Create a 15-20 question quiz:

**Question types**:
- Multiple choice (10-12 questions)
- True/False (3-5 questions)
- Scenario-based (2-3 questions)

**Coverage**:
- 40% foundational knowledge (definitions, concepts)
- 40% application (how to handle situations)
- 20% edge cases or troubleshooting

For each question:
- The question
- 4 answer options (A, B, C, D) for multiple choice
- Correct answer (marked)
- Brief explanation of why it's correct

Difficulty:
- 60% easy/medium (basic concepts)
- 30% medium (requires understanding)
- 10% hard (requires critical thinking)

Passing score: 80% (12/15 correct)

Format questions clearly, avoid trick questions or ambiguous wording.
```

---

### Step 4: Create Training Script Template (45 minutes)

**Video/Presentation Script Template**:
```
Write a training script for a [LENGTH - e.g., 10-minute] video on [TOPIC]:

Topic: [E.G., "How to use our CRM"]
Audience: [E.G., "New sales reps"]
Learning objectives (what they'll be able to do after):
1. [OBJECTIVE 1 - e.g., "Log new leads in CRM"]
2. [OBJECTIVE 2 - e.g., "Update deal stages"]
3. [OBJECTIVE 3 - e.g., "Generate sales reports"]

Create a script with:

**Introduction** (60 seconds):
- Hook: Why this matters / problem this solves
- What they'll learn
- Duration and format

**Main Content** (8 minutes):
Section 1: [TOPIC - e.g., "Adding a New Lead"] (2-3 min)
- Explain concept
- Demonstrate step-by-step
- Show common mistakes to avoid

Section 2: [TOPIC] (2-3 min)
- [Follow same format]

Section 3: [TOPIC] (2-3 min)
- [Follow same format]

**Conclusion** (60 seconds):
- Recap key points (3 bullets)
- Next steps (practice exercise, quiz, etc.)
- Where to get help

**Visuals/Slides**:
- For each section, note: [VISUAL: Description of what to show on screen]

**Interactivity** (if applicable):
- Pause points: "Pause here and try X"
- Knowledge checks: "Before continuing, can you name the 3 steps?"

Tone: Conversational, encouraging, patient
Length: ~1,500-2,000 words (spoken aloud)
Pacing: 150-160 words per minute
```

---

### Step 5: Train Content Creators (30 minutes per person)

**Training Session Agenda**:

**0:00-0:10 - Why AI for Training Materials**
- Show time savings (4 hours → 48 min for SOP)
- Explain AI as drafting assistant, SME provides expertise
- Address concerns: "Will AI get technical details right?" → You verify and add expertise

**0:10-0:20 - Demo SOP Creation**
- Pick a real process
- Show: Rough notes from SME → AI-generated SOP → SME edits for accuracy
- Emphasize: AI structures, you add domain knowledge

**0:20-0:25 - Hands-On Practice**
- Creator picks a process they know well
- Uses template to create SOP
- Reviews output, edits for accuracy

**0:25-0:30 - Q&A and Guidelines**
- When to use: SOPs, onboarding docs, quizzes, scripts
- When NOT to use: Final training without SME review
- Set expectation: Create 3 training docs this week with AI, track time

## Advanced Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Convert Tribal Knowledge to Documentation

**Prompt**:
```
I'm going to describe how we do [PROCESS], and I need you to turn it into a clear SOP.

Here's how we currently do it (unstructured notes from team member):

"""
[PASTE MESSY NOTES, EMAIL THREAD, OR VERBAL EXPLANATION]
"""

Transform this into a structured SOP with:
1. Clear step-by-step instructions
2. Decision points (if X, then Y)
3. Common mistakes and how to avoid
4. Quality checks

Make it so someone who's never done this can follow it.
```

**Use Case**: Capture knowledge from experienced employees before they leave

---

### Use Case 2: Create Multi-Format Training

**Prompt**:
```
Take this training content and adapt it for 3 formats:

Original content:
[PASTE SOP, POLICY, OR TRAINING DOC]

Create:

1. **Quick Reference Guide** (1-page):
   - Key steps only (bullets)
   - Printable cheat sheet
   - Visual/table format

2. **Video Script** (5-min):
   - Conversational walkthrough
   - Demonstrate key steps
   - Include visual cues

3. **Interactive Quiz** (10 questions):
   - Test understanding
   - Scenario-based questions
   - Include explanations

All formats should cover the same core content, just adapted for different learning styles.
```

---

### Use Case 3: Update Outdated Training Materials

**Prompt**:
```
Update this training document to reflect new [PROCESS/TOOL/POLICY]:

Current training doc:
[PASTE OLD VERSION]

What changed:
1. [CHANGE 1 - e.g., "We now use Slack instead of email for internal comms"]
2. [CHANGE 2 - e.g., "New approval workflow requires manager sign-off"]
3. [CHANGE 3]

Update the document to:
- Reflect all changes
- Maintain same structure and tone
- Highlight what's new (add "NEW:" labels)
- Update screenshots placeholders
- Revise quiz questions if applicable

Mark sections that changed with [UPDATED] tag so I can review.
```

## Best Practices

### DO ✅

1. **Have SME review all AI-generated content**
   - AI structures, SME verifies accuracy
   - Add domain-specific details AI doesn't know
   - Ensure compliance and safety information is correct

2. **Use real examples**
   - Give AI actual screenshots, documents, scenarios
   - Ask for realistic examples, not generic ones
   - Include edge cases and troubleshooting

3. **Test with actual learners**
   - Give training to new hire and observe
   - Where do they get confused? Update those sections.
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Version control training docs**
   - Date every document
   - Track what changed and why
   - Archive old versions

5. **Make it searchable**
   - Use clear headings
   - Create index of all training materials
   - Tag by role, department, topic

### DON'T ❌

1. **Don't publish without SME review**
   - AI may invent steps or miss critical details
   - Verify all technical information
   - Especially important for compliance, safety, legal topics

2. **Don't skip screenshots and visuals**
   - AI can write great instructions
   - But can't create actual screenshots
   - Take real screenshots, add to AI-generated doc

3. **Don't create training without learning objectives**
   - Start with: "After this training, learner will be able to..."
   - Everything in training should support those objectives
   - Cut content that doesn't serve objectives

4. **Don't forget to update**
   - When process changes, update training immediately
   - Outdated training is worse than no training
   - Set quarterly review reminders

5. **Don't over-complicate**
   - Simple, clear > comprehensive, confusing
   - Break complex topics into multiple docs
   - Use short sentences and simple words

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: AI Invents Steps That Don't Exist

**Problem**: AI-generated SOP includes steps that aren't part of actual process.

**Solution**:
- Provide very detailed process notes to AI
- Have SME review line-by-line
- Test SOP with new person, observe where they get stuck

---

### Pitfall 2: Training Is Too Generic

**Problem**: Content sounds like it could be for any company, not yours.

**Solution**:
- Include company-specific examples in prompt
- Add your actual screenshots, tool names, role titles
- Customize AI output with internal terminology and examples

---

### Pitfall 3: Quiz Questions Are Too Easy

**Problem**: Quiz doesn't actually test understanding, everyone gets 100%.

**Solution**:
- Ask AI for scenario-based questions (not just recall)
- Include "common mistakes" questions
- Test quiz yourself - if you'd get 100% without taking the course, it's too easy

---

### Pitfall 4: Training Materials Become Outdated

**Problem**: Process changes but training doesn't get updated.

**Solution**:
- Assign owner for each training doc
- Set quarterly review reminders
- When process changes, update training the same day
- Use AI to quickly update: "Update this SOP to reflect [change]"

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Startup (30 employees)

**Before AI**:
- Onboarding was ad-hoc (verbal training, shadowing)
- No documented SOPs
- New hires took 90 days to full productivity

**After AI** (3 months):
- Created 15 SOPs in 2 weeks (would have taken 2 months manually)
- 30-day onboarding checklist with all resources
- New hires to full productivity in 60 days (33% faster)

**ROI**:
- Time saved creating training: 48 hours × $50/hour = $2,400
- Faster ramp time: 30 days × $200/day (new hire productivity) = $6,000/hire × 10 hires/year = $60,000/year
- Tool cost: ChatGPT Plus $20/month = $240/year
- **ROI: 260x**

**Team feedback**:
- "We went from no documentation to a complete onboarding program in 3 weeks."

---

### Example 2: Professional Services Firm (100 employees)

**Before AI**:
- 50+ SOPs, all outdated (2-3 years old)
- Updating them manually would take 200+ hours
- New hires confused by inconsistent training

**After AI** (2 months):
- Used AI to bulk-update all 50 SOPs (20 hours total vs 200)
- SMEs reviewed and approved (30 hours)
- Created quiz for each SOP (AI-generated, 10 hours)

**ROI**:
- Time saved: 150 hours × $60/hour = $9,000
- Better compliance: Reduced errors from outdated processes
- Tool cost: ChatGPT Plus $20/month × 2 people = $480/year
- **ROI: 19x in first project alone**

**Manager feedback**:
- "Updating 50 SOPs was a project we kept putting off for years. AI made it achievable in weeks."

---

### Example 3: E-commerce Company (50 employees)

**Before AI**:
- Created training videos from scratch (8 hours per 10-min video)
- 5 videos/year = 40 hours on video scripts and prep

**After AI** (6 months):
- AI writes video scripts (1 hour each)
- Record and edit videos (same time as before)
- 5 videos/year = 5 hours on scripts (87% time savings)

**ROI**:
- Time saved: 35 hours/year × $50/hour = $1,750/year
- Can now create 15 videos/year instead of 5 (3x content)
- Tool cost: ChatGPT Plus $20/month = $240/year
- **ROI: 7x + 3x more training content**

**Trainer feedback**:
- "I used to dread writing scripts. Now AI does the first draft and I just polish it."
