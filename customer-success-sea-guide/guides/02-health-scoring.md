# AI-Powered Customer Health Scoring for SEA

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-07
**Setup Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Expected ROI**: Identify at-risk accounts 60-90 days earlier, reduce churn by 20-30%

---

## The Problem

Traditional customer health scoring in SEA fails because:

- ❌ **Lagging indicators only** — NPS surveys and support tickets tell you customers are ALREADY churning
- ❌ **Manual score updates** — Quarterly or monthly updates = decisions on stale data
- ❌ **Reactive, not predictive** — You learn about churn when customer cancels (too late to save)
- ❌ **Western engagement signals** — Phone calls and emails aren't primary channels in SEA (WhatsApp/LINE are)
- ❌ **Misses cultural nuances** — In MY/ID/TH, customers won't complain directly (they just go silent)

**Why Traditional Health Scoring Fails in SEA**:

| Western Health Metrics | SEA Reality |
|------------------------|-------------|
| "Customer will tell us if unhappy" (NPS, CSAT) | Customers avoid confrontation (relationship cultures) |
| "Low email opens = disengagement" | Email isn't primary channel (WhatsApp 85-90% open rate) |
| "Support tickets = bad health" | SEA customers avoid bothering you (even when stuck) |
| "Low meeting attendance = churn risk" | Formal meetings less common (prefer chat-based communication) |
| "Green score = safe account" | Silent accounts can be the highest risk |

## The AI-First Transformation

### Before (Manual Health Scoring)
- **Data sources**: NPS surveys (quarterly), support ticket count, last meeting date
- **Update frequency**: Monthly or quarterly
- **Scoring method**: Manual spreadsheet or basic CRM automation
- **Prediction horizon**: 0-30 days (reactive)
- **Result**: "Green" accounts churn unexpectedly

### After (AI-Powered Health Scoring)
- **Data sources**: Usage patterns, feature adoption velocity, stakeholder changes, sentiment from support/chat, engagement across channels
- **Update frequency**: Weekly or real-time
- **Scoring method**: AI analyzes patterns + predicts churn risk
- **Prediction horizon**: 60-90 days (predictive)
- **Result**: Early warnings with time to intervene

**Impact**: Catch churn signals 2-3 months earlier, 20-30% churn reduction

## SEA-Specific Health Signals

### Indonesia/Malaysia/Thailand: Silent Churn Patterns

In relationship cultures, customers won't tell you they're unhappy. Watch for:

**🔴 Red Flags (SEA-Specific)**:
1. **Response time increasing**:
   - Week 1-4: Respond to WhatsApp within 2 hours
   - Week 5+: Respond within 24-48 hours or not at all
   - **Interpretation**: Deprioritizing relationship (but won't say so)

2. **Switched to short/polite responses**:
   - Before: Detailed, engaged messages
   - After: "Yes", "OK", "Will check" (minimal engagement)
   - **Interpretation**: Maintaining face while disengaging

3. **Champion suddenly "too busy"**:
   - Pattern: Cancels 2-3 meetings in a row, cites "busy"
   - **Interpretation**: Avoiding confrontation (doesn't want to say there's a problem)

4. **Executive sponsor MIA**:
   - Pattern: Sponsor was engaged, now unreachable
   - **Interpretation**: Priorities shifted (product deprioritized)

**AI Prompt (SEA Silent Churn Detection)**:
```
Analyze [COMPANY NAME] in [COUNTRY] for silent churn patterns.

Engagement history:
- [PASTE LAST 4-6 WEEKS OF INTERACTION SUMMARY]

Look for:
1. Response time trend (increasing = risk)
2. Message length/detail trend (shortening = disengagement)
3. Meeting cancellation pattern
4. Stakeholder availability changes
5. Shift from proactive → reactive-only

Generate a Silent Churn Risk Analysis:
- Risk level: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH]
- Evidence: [SPECIFIC PATTERNS]
- Cultural interpretation: In [COUNTRY], this means...
- Recommended intervention: [CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE OUTREACH]
```

## Common Health Scoring Mistakes in SEA

### Mistake #1: Over-Relying on NPS/CSAT
**What happens**: In SEA, customers give inflated scores to avoid confrontation. 4/5 NPS might be "politely declining".

**Western approach**: Trust NPS/CSAT scores at face value
**SEA approach**: Weight usage data and engagement trends higher than surveys

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Analyze [COMPANY] health. Their NPS is 4/5 but usage dropped 40%. In [COUNTRY], interpret this discrepancy and predict actual churn risk."
```

---

### Mistake #2: Ignoring WhatsApp/LINE Engagement
**What happens**: You track email opens (20-30%) and miss that customer is active on WhatsApp (85-90% engagement).

**Western approach**: Email-centric engagement tracking
**SEA approach**: Multi-channel engagement (WhatsApp >> Email)

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Customer hasn't opened emails but responds to WhatsApp within 1 hour. What's their true engagement level in [COUNTRY]?"
```

---

### Mistake #3: Treating "Silent" as "Healthy"
**What happens**: Customer stops responding but doesn't complain. You assume everything is fine. They churn.

**Western approach**: "No news is good news"
**SEA approach**: "Silence is a red flag in relationship cultures"

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Customer in [MY/ID/TH] has gone from 5 messages/week to 1 message/week. Response time increased from 2h to 48h. They haven't complained. Assess churn risk."
```

---

### Mistake #4: Waiting for "Red" Scores to Act
**What happens**: By the time score drops to "red", customer has mentally checked out. Too late to save.

**Western approach**: Intervene at <60 health score
**SEA approach**: Intervene at <75 health score (earlier)

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Customer at 72 health score (barely yellow). In [COUNTRY], should we intervene proactively or wait for red?"
```
