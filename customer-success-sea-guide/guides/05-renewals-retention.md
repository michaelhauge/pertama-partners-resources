# AI-Powered Renewals & Retention for Southeast Asia

## Why This Matters

**The AI transformation for renewals:**
- **Renewal prep**: 8-12 hours → 45 minutes (93% reduction)
- **Risk detection**: 14 days before renewal → 90 days before (6x earlier)
- **Renewal rate**: +15-25% with AI-powered retention workflows
- **Manual renewal decks**: 4-6 hours → AI generates in 12 minutes

**Traditional renewal workflow (manual)**:
- Month 11: CSM starts renewal prep (8-12 hours)
- Month 12: Renewal meeting scheduled (week 1-2)
- Week 3-4: Negotiation and contract finalization
- **Problem**: Reactive, high pressure, limited time to address objections

**AI-first renewal workflow**:
- Month 9: AI detects renewal risk signals (90 days early)
- Month 10: AI generates renewal value deck + expansion opportunities
- Month 11: Proactive renewal meeting (no surprises)
- Month 12: Smooth finalization (80% pre-approved)

## AI Renewal Framework Overview

### The 4-Stage AI Renewal Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AI RENEWAL FRAMEWORK                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STAGE 1: EARLY DETECTION (90 days before renewal)
├─ AI scans renewal cohort for risk signals
├─ Flags at-risk renewals (health score <70, usage decline, etc.)
├─ Prioritizes by risk level + ARR impact
└─ Output: Renewal risk report (ranked list)

STAGE 2: VALUE QUANTIFICATION (60-75 days before)
├─ AI generates renewal value deck (ROI, usage stats, wins)
├─ Identifies expansion opportunities (upsell, cross-sell)
├─ Creates personalized renewal proposal
└─ Output: Renewal deck + expansion pitch

STAGE 3: PROACTIVE RENEWAL MEETING (45-60 days before)
├─ CSM presents AI-generated value deck
├─ Addresses objections with AI-suggested responses
├─ Discusses expansion if customer is healthy
└─ Output: Verbal commitment or objection list

STAGE 4: FINALIZATION (30-45 days before)
├─ AI drafts renewal contract + pricing
├─ Handles price increase communication (if applicable)
├─ Tracks renewal status (pending, approved, at-risk)
└─ Output: Signed renewal contract
```

### Time Compression Metrics

| Task | Manual Time | AI Time | Savings |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Renewal risk analysis | 3-4 hours | 8 minutes | 95% |
| Renewal value deck creation | 4-6 hours | 12 minutes | 96% |
| Objection response prep | 2-3 hours | 5 minutes | 97% |
| Renewal proposal drafting | 2-3 hours | 10 minutes | 94% |
| **Total renewal prep** | **11-16 hours** | **35 minutes** | **96%** |

Generate an Objection Response Strategy:

## OBJECTION ANALYSIS

**Objection Type**: [BUDGET / VALUE / USAGE / COMPETITOR / STAKEHOLDER / BUSINESS DISRUPTION]

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
[WHAT IS THE REAL UNDERLYING ISSUE? E.G., "BUDGET OBJECTION" MIGHT ACTUALLY BE "VALUE PERCEPTION ISSUE"]

**Severity**:
- [ ] 🟢 LOW — Easily addressable
- [ ] 🟡 MEDIUM — Requires negotiation or concession
- [ ] 🔴 HIGH — May result in churn if not handled well

**SEA Cultural Context**:
In [COUNTRY]:
- **What this objection likely means**: [INTERPRET OBJECTION THROUGH CULTURAL LENS]
  - Example: In Malaysia, "budget is tight" often means "we need to feel valued and receive a relationship-based concession" (not necessarily a hard budget constraint)
- **Recommended response style**: [DIRECT / CONSULTATIVE / RELATIONSHIP-FIRST / ESCALATION]

---

## RESPONSE STRATEGY

### Step 1: Acknowledge & Validate (Immediate Response)

**What to say** (via WhatsApp/LINE or email):

"Hi [NAME], thank you for sharing that with me. I completely understand [PARAPHRASE OBJECTION]. Let me [PROPOSE NEXT STEP — E.G., 'PUT TOGETHER SOME OPTIONS' OR 'SCHEDULE A CALL TO DISCUSS']."

**Tone**:
- [IF SG/PH]: Professional, solutions-oriented
- [IF MY/ID/TH]: Empathetic, relationship-focused
- [IF VN]: Practical, collaborative

---

### Step 2: Gather More Information (Discovery Questions)

Before offering solutions, ask clarifying questions:

**Questions to ask**:
1. [QUESTION 1] — Goal: [WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN]
2. [QUESTION 2] — Goal: [WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN]
3. [QUESTION 3] — Goal: [WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN]

**Example**:
- If objection is "budget is tight":
  - Q1: "Can you help me understand what's driving the budget pressure?" (Learn: Is it company-wide cost-cutting or department-specific?)
  - Q2: "Are there specific cost targets you need to hit?" (Learn: Is this a hard cap or a negotiation starting point?)
  - Q3: "If we could demonstrate stronger ROI, would that change the budget conversation?" (Learn: Is this truly budget or value perception?)

---

### Step 3: Reframe Value (Reinforcement)

**Value reinforcement message**:

"I wanted to remind you of the value [PRODUCT] has delivered over the past [X MONTHS/YEARS]:

**Quantified outcomes**:
- [OUTCOME 1]: [BEFORE] → [AFTER] ([X% IMPROVEMENT])
- [OUTCOME 2]: [BEFORE] → [AFTER] ([X% IMPROVEMENT])
- [OUTCOME 3]: [BEFORE] → [AFTER] ([X% IMPROVEMENT])

**ROI summary**:
- Annual investment: [AMOUNT]
- Value delivered: [AMOUNT]
- ROI: [X:1]

**Translation**: For every [CURRENCY]1 you invest, you're getting [CURRENCY][X] back in [TIME SAVED / REVENUE INCREASE / COST REDUCTION].

Does this align with your experience?"

**Goal**: Reanchor conversation around value, not just cost.

---

### Step 4: Offer Solutions (Tailored to Objection Type)

**[IF OBJECTION = BUDGET / PRICING]**

**Option 1: Payment flexibility**
- Switch from annual to monthly (lower upfront cost)
- Extend payment terms (e.g., Net 60 instead of Net 30)
- Split invoice across 2-3 months

**Option 2: Rightsizing**
- Reduce seat count to match active users (e.g., 50 seats → 35 seats)
- Downgrade tier if lower-tier features suffice
- Pause expansion plans, renew current tier only

**Option 3: Multi-year lock-in discount**
- 2-year contract: [X%] discount
- 3-year contract: [Y%] discount
- Trade: Customer commits longer, you reduce effective cost

**Option 4: Value-add instead of discount**
- Include free training (value: [AMOUNT])
- Add premium support (value: [AMOUNT])
- Provide custom integration (value: [AMOUNT])

**Recommendation**: [WHICH OPTION MAKES MOST SENSE GIVEN CONTEXT]

---

**[IF OBJECTION = VALUE PERCEPTION / LOW USAGE]**

**Option 1: Adoption boost plan**
- Schedule 2-3 training sessions to increase feature adoption
- Identify 5 underutilized features that would deliver value
- Set 30-day adoption goals (e.g., "Get 10 more users active")

**Option 2: Success plan reset**
- Revisit original goals — are they still relevant?
- Set new goals for next 12 months
- Create accountability framework (monthly check-ins)

**Option 3: Pilot advanced features**
- Trial higher-tier features for 30 days (no cost)
- If value is demonstrated, upsell at renewal
- If not, renew at current tier

**Recommendation**: [WHICH OPTION MAKES MOST SENSE]

---

**[IF OBJECTION = COMPETITOR COMPARISON]**

**Option 1: TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) analysis**
- Compare [YOUR PRODUCT] vs [COMPETITOR]:
  - Subscription cost: [YOUR PRICE] vs [THEIR PRICE]
  - Implementation cost: [YOUR COST] vs [THEIR COST]
  - Training cost: [YOUR COST] vs [THEIR COST]
  - Support cost: [YOUR COST] vs [THEIR COST]
  - Switching cost: [MIGRATION TIME × TEAM HOURLY RATE]
- **Total 1-year cost**: [YOUR TCO] vs [THEIR TCO]

**Option 2: Feature comparison**
- Create side-by-side comparison table
- Highlight features they're currently using that competitor doesn't offer
- Quantify switching risk (e.g., "You'd lose [FEATURE], which saves you [X HOURS/WEEK]")

**Option 3: Switching cost analysis**
- Migration effort: [X HOURS/DAYS]
- Downtime: [X HOURS/DAYS]
- Re-training: [X HOURS PER USER]
- **Total switching cost**: [AMOUNT] — "Is the [PRICE DIFFERENCE] worth [SWITCHING COST]?"

**Recommendation**: [WHICH OPTION MAKES MOST SENSE]

---

**[IF OBJECTION = STAKEHOLDER CHANGE]**

**Option 1: New stakeholder onboarding**
- Schedule 30-minute intro call with new decision-maker
- Present condensed value deck (6 slides instead of 12)
- Offer 30-day evaluation period (no commitment) to build confidence

**Option 2: Executive business case**
- Create 1-page business case for new decision-maker
- Include: problem solved, value delivered, ROI, cost of switching
- Position as "here's what your predecessor valued — does this align with your priorities?"

**Option 3: Pilot renewal (short-term bridge)**
- Offer 3-month renewal instead of 12-month
- Gives new stakeholder time to evaluate without long commitment
- After 3 months, convert to annual renewal

**Recommendation**: [WHICH OPTION MAKES MOST SENSE]

---

**[IF OBJECTION = BUSINESS DISRUPTION (ACQUISITION, RESTRUCTURING)]**

**Option 1: Flexible terms**
- Month-to-month renewal (cancel anytime)
- 6-month bridge contract (wait for clarity)
- Pause agreement (suspend for 3-6 months, resume later)

**Option 2: Executive escalation**
- Escalate to your executive team (VP CS, CRO, CEO)
- Offer strategic partnership discussion (not just renewal)
- Position as "we want to support you through this transition"

**Option 3: Survival mode discount**
- Temporary pricing reduction (e.g., 30% off for 6 months)
- After 6 months, return to normal pricing
- Trade: You help them survive, they commit long-term after

**Recommendation**: [WHICH OPTION MAKES MOST SENSE]

---

### Step 5: Propose Next Steps

**Recommended next steps**:
1. [ACTION 1] — Owner: [CSM / CUSTOMER / BOTH] — Timeline: [DATE]
2. [ACTION 2] — Owner: [CSM / CUSTOMER / BOTH] — Timeline: [DATE]
3. [ACTION 3] — Owner: [CSM / CUSTOMER / BOTH] — Timeline: [DATE]

**Meeting proposal**:
"Can we schedule a [20 / 30 / 45-MINUTE] call on [DAY/TIME] to discuss these options? I want to make sure we find a solution that works for your team."

**Escalation decision**:
- [ ] CSM can handle this objection
- [ ] Manager escalation needed
- [ ] Executive escalation needed

---

## FALLBACK PLAN (IF NEGOTIATION FAILS)

**If customer is still hesitant**:

**Option A: Extend decision deadline**
- Give customer 14 extra days to decide
- Use time to run adoption boost plan or deliver quick win

**Option B: Executive save play**
- Escalate to your exec team (CEO-to-CEO call)
- Offer one-time strategic concession

**Option C: Downgrade instead of churn**
- Offer lower tier at reduced cost (keep relationship alive)
- Position as "bridge" — they can upgrade later

**Option D: Accept churn, preserve relationship**
- Conduct exit interview (learn why you lost them)
- Offer to help with offboarding (leave door open for future)
- Ask for referral or testimonial (salvage something)

**When to walk away**:
- Customer demands >40% discount with no commitment
- Customer shows no sign of value realization (usage <10%)
- Customer has unpaid invoices or payment issues
- Customer is abusive or disrespectful to team

---

## SEA-SPECIFIC OBJECTION HANDLING TIPS

**Singapore**:

## Multi-Year & Enterprise Renewals

### Why Multi-Year Renewals Matter

**Benefits for customer:**
- Price lock (protection against future increases)
- Budget predictability (CFO loves this)
- Priority support/roadmap access

**Benefits for you:**
- Revenue security (locked ARR for 2-3 years)
- Lower churn risk (harder to switch mid-contract)
- Higher LTV (lifetime value per customer)

**Typical multi-year discount structure:**
- 1-year: Full price
- 2-year: 10-15% discount
- 3-year: 20-25% discount

---

### When to Offer Multi-Year Renewals

**Ideal candidates for multi-year:**
- ✅ Health score >80 (healthy customers only)
- ✅ Usage stable or growing (not declining)
- ✅ Strong ROI demonstrated (3:1 or better)
- ✅ Champion is stable (not leaving soon)
- ✅ No pending business disruption (acquisition, restructuring)

**Red flags — don't offer multi-year:**
- ❌ Health score <70 (at-risk customers)
- ❌ Usage declining >20% over last 90 days
- ❌ Unresolved support issues or complaints
- ❌ Champion recently left or unresponsive
- ❌ Company in acquisition talks or financial distress

---

**Email template** (send 60-75 days before renewal):

**Subject**: Partnership Renewal — Multi-Year Option for [COMPANY]

Hi [NAME],

As we approach your renewal date ([DATE]), I wanted to present a multi-year partnership option that locks in pricing and gives you priority access to our roadmap.

**Why multi-year?**
- **Price protection**: Lock in today's pricing (we typically increase prices [X%] annually)
- **Budget predictability**: CFO-friendly (no surprises)
- **Priority roadmap access**: We prioritize feature requests from multi-year customers

### Enterprise Renewal Considerations

**Enterprise renewals (ARR >$50K or >$100K)** require special handling:

**Key differences from SMB renewals:**
- **Longer sales cycle**: 60-90 days (vs 30-45 for SMB)
- **Multiple stakeholders**: Legal, finance, procurement, IT, end-user team
- **Formal RFP process**: Some enterprises require annual re-evaluation
- **Executive involvement**: C-level or VP-level approval required
- **Custom terms**: MSAs, security reviews, custom SLAs

**Enterprise renewal checklist:**
- [ ] Identify all stakeholders (create RACI matrix)
- [ ] Engage legal/procurement 90 days before renewal
- [ ] Prepare security/compliance documentation
- [ ] Schedule executive business review (EBR) 60 days before
- [ ] Present multi-year proposal with ROI business case
- [ ] Negotiate terms (payment, auto-renewal, cancellation clauses)
- [ ] Obtain internal approval (legal, finance, security sign-off)
- [ ] Finalize contract 30 days before renewal date

---

## Price Increase Communication (SEA)

### When to Increase Prices at Renewal

**Valid reasons for price increase:**
- ✅ Annual inflation adjustment (5-10% in SEA)
- ✅ Significant new features/value added
- ✅ Initial discount expiring (e.g., "first-year discount")
- ✅ Expansion (more seats, higher tier)

**When NOT to increase price:**
- ❌ Customer health score <75 (at-risk)
- ❌ Usage declining or stagnant
- ❌ Recent support issues or complaints
- ❌ Competitive pressure (customer evaluating alternatives)
- ❌ Business disruption (acquisition, financial distress)

---

### Price Increase Communication Template (SEA-Adapted)

**Singapore (direct approach):**

**Subject**: Renewal Pricing Update — [COMPANY]

Hi [NAME],

As we approach your renewal date ([DATE]), I wanted to give you advance notice of a pricing update.

**Current pricing**: [AMOUNT/MONTH OR /YEAR]
**New pricing** (effective [DATE]): [AMOUNT/MONTH OR /YEAR] ([X%] increase)

**Why the increase?**
- [REASON 1, e.g., "Annual adjustment to reflect inflation and operational costs"]
- [REASON 2, e.g., "Significant new features launched: [FEATURE 1], [FEATURE 2]"]

**Value delivered**:
- ROI: [X:1]
- Usage: [X%] of team active
- Outcomes: [BRIEF SUMMARY]

**Your options**:
1. Renew at new pricing ([AMOUNT])
2. Lock in current pricing with 2-year commitment ([AMOUNT/YEAR] × 2 years)
3. Discuss rightsizing (reduce seats to offset increase)

Let me know if you'd like to discuss. Happy to schedule a quick call.

Best,
[CSM NAME]

## Renewal Metrics & Dashboards

### Key Renewal Metrics to Track

| Metric | Definition | Target (SaaS Benchmark) | SEA Reality |
|--------|------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Gross Renewal Rate (GRR)** | % of ARR renewed (excluding expansion) | 85-90% | 75-85% (SEA) |
| **Net Renewal Rate (NRR)** | % of ARR renewed + expansion | 100-120% | 90-110% (SEA) |
| **Logo Retention** | % of customers that renew | 90-95% | 85-92% (SEA) |
| **Renewal Rate by Cohort** | % renewal for each signup cohort | Track over time | Varies by market |
| **Time to Renew** | Days from renewal date to signed contract | <30 days | 30-60 days (SEA) |
| **Renewal Conversion Cycle** | Days from first renewal outreach to signature | <45 days | 45-75 days (SEA) |
| **Expansion at Renewal** | % of renewals that also expand | 15-25% | 10-20% (SEA) |

**Why SEA reality differs:**
- Longer decision-making cycles (relationship cultures, bureaucracy)
- Budget constraints in emerging markets (ID, PH, VN)
- Higher price sensitivity (vs US/EU)
- Less familiarity with SaaS renewal norms

## SEA-Specific Renewal Strategies

### Renewal Timing by Country

| Country | Standard Renewal Lead Time | Cultural Considerations | Preferred Channel |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Singapore** | 45-60 days | Direct, efficient — decision within 14-21 days | Email primary, WhatsApp for urgency |
| **Malaysia** | 60-75 days | Relationship-first — allow 21-30 days for decision | WhatsApp primary (80%+ response) |
| **Indonesia** | 60-90 days | Relationship-first, risk-averse — slow decisions | WhatsApp primary, in-person ideal |
| **Thailand** | 60-90 days | Hierarchical — senior approval needed, slow | LINE primary (90%+ in TH market) |
| **Vietnam** | 60-75 days | Bureaucratic approval layers — allow 21-30 days | Zalo or WhatsApp, email for formal |
| **Philippines** | 45-60 days | Friendly, flexible — decision within 14-21 days | WhatsApp or Viber, email acceptable |

**Key insight**: SEA renewals take 30-50% longer than US/EU due to:
- Relationship-based decision-making (MY, ID, TH)
- Hierarchical approval processes (TH, VN)
- Budget cycles tied to government fiscal years in some markets

### Objection Handling Nuances by Country

**"Budget is tight" objection:**

| Country | What It Really Means | How to Respond |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Singapore** | Actual budget constraint OR evaluating alternatives | Direct ROI reinforcement + offer payment flexibility |
| **Malaysia** | "We want to feel valued" OR testing your flexibility | Offer value-add (training, support) instead of discount |
| **Indonesia** | "We want to feel valued" OR genuine budget pressure | Relationship-first approach + flexible payment terms |
| **Thailand** | Polite way of saying "not seeing enough value" | Humble value reinforcement + offer to improve adoption |
| **Vietnam** | Actual budget constraint OR seeking better deal | Practical ROI + peer examples + multi-year discount |
| **Philippines** | Testing flexibility OR genuine constraint | Friendly negotiation + payment plans + value-add |

**"Not seeing enough value" objection:**

| Country | How to Respond |
|---------|----------------|
| **Singapore** | Data-driven value reinforcement (ROI, usage stats, outcomes) |
| **Malaysia/Indonesia** | Relationship-based discussion — "Let's figure out how to make this more valuable together" |
| **Thailand** | Humble, consultative approach — "We want to support your goals better. Can you help us understand what's missing?" |
| **Vietnam** | Practical outcomes focus — "Here's what similar companies achieved. How can we help you get there?" |
| **Philippines** | Team-oriented problem-solving — "Let's work on this together. What would make this more valuable for your team?" |

### Discount & Negotiation Norms

**Discount expectations by country:**

| Country | Expected Discount Range | Negotiation Style | Multi-Year Incentive |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Singapore** | 5-10% (professional services norm) | Direct, metrics-based | 10-15% for 2-year |
| **Malaysia** | 10-15% (relationship cultures expect flexibility) | Collaborative | 15-20% for 2-year |
| **Indonesia** | 10-20% (emerging market, price-sensitive) | Relationship-first | 15-25% for 2-year |
| **Thailand** | 10-15% (expect politeness, not aggression) | Polite, indirect | 15-20% for 2-year |
| **Vietnam** | 10-15% (practical negotiators) | Direct but respectful | 15-20% for 2-year |
| **Philippines** | 10-15% (friendly negotiation expected) | Warm, collaborative | 15-20% for 2-year |

**When to offer discount vs value-add:**
- **Discount**: Customer has actual budget constraint, competitive pressure, or multi-year commitment
- **Value-add**: Customer wants to feel valued, relationship-based negotiation, you want to avoid race to bottom

**Value-add alternatives to discount** (SEA-tested):
- Free training sessions (worth $500-$2,000)
- Upgraded support tier (worth $1,000-$5,000/year)
- Custom integration or onboarding (worth $2,000-$10,000)
- Priority roadmap access (perceived value: high)

### Multi-Currency Renewal Pricing

**Pricing by currency** (2026 rates — adjust for current FX):

| Country | Currency | Renewal Invoice Format | Payment Terms |
|---------|----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Singapore** | SGD | SGD pricing (or USD acceptable) | Net 30 |
| **Malaysia** | MYR | MYR pricing preferred | Net 30-45 |
| **Indonesia** | IDR | IDR pricing critical (large numbers, e.g., Rp 50 juta) | Net 45-60 |
| **Thailand** | THB | THB pricing preferred | Net 30-45 |
| **Vietnam** | VND | VND pricing preferred (e.g., 50 triệu đồng) | Net 45-60 |
| **Philippines** | PHP | PHP pricing preferred | Net 30-45 |

**Pro tip**: In Indonesia and Vietnam, use local currency to avoid:
- Sticker shock (USD amounts look huge when converted)
- FX risk (customer bears exchange rate fluctuations if invoiced in USD)
- Payment friction (some banks charge fees for USD transfers)

**Example**:
- **USD pricing**: $1,000/month (looks expensive in IDR)
- **IDR pricing**: Rp 15,750,000/month (14,000 IDR/USD rate) — feels more reasonable

### Holidays & Renewal Timing in SEA

**Avoid renewal deadlines during:**
- **Lunar New Year** (Jan/Feb) — All SEA markets slow down for 1-2 weeks
- **Hari Raya / Eid al-Fitr** (varies) — Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore (Muslim-majority)
- **Songkran** (April 13-15) — Thailand (entire country shuts down)
- **Chinese New Year** (Jan/Feb) — Singapore, Malaysia (significant Chinese population)
- **Christmas/New Year** (Dec 20 - Jan 5) — Philippines (90% Catholic)

**Ideal renewal timing:**
- **SG**: Avoid Dec (budgeting season), Feb (CNY)
- **MY/ID**: Avoid Jan-Feb (CNY + Hari Raya prep), June-July (Hari Raya)
- **TH**: Avoid April (Songkran), Dec-Jan (year-end)
- **VN**: Avoid Jan-Feb (Tết), Sept (National Day prep)
- **PH**: Avoid Dec (Christmas), March-April (Holy Week)

**Workaround**: If renewal falls during holiday, push renewal meeting 2-3 weeks earlier (or 1-2 weeks after holiday).

## Conclusion: AI-First Renewal Workflow

### Before AI (Manual Renewal Process)
- **Time per renewal**: 11-16 hours (risk analysis, deck creation, objection prep, proposal drafting)
- **Renewal prep start**: 30-45 days before renewal (reactive)
- **Risk detection**: 14 days before renewal (too late to fix issues)
- **Objection handling**: Brainstorm responses on the fly (inconsistent quality)
- **Forecast accuracy**: Low (gut feel, not data-driven)

### After AI (AI-First Renewal Process)
- **Time per renewal**: 35-60 minutes (96% time savings)
- **Renewal prep start**: 90 days before renewal (proactive)
- **Risk detection**: 60-90 days early (time to fix issues)
- **Objection handling**: AI-generated response strategies (consistent, data-backed)
- **Forecast accuracy**: High (scenario planning based on health score trends)

### ROI of AI-First Renewals
- **CSM capacity**: 1 CSM can manage 2-3x more renewals
- **Renewal rate improvement**: +15-25% (early detection → higher saves)
- **Expansion at renewal**: +10-20% (AI identifies opportunities)
- **Customer experience**: Better (proactive, value-focused, not last-minute pressure)
