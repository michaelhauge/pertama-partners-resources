## Multiple High Scores? Priority Framework

If you scored HIGH (15-25 points) in multiple sections, use this framework:

### 1. Start with Health Monitoring IF:
- You have unexpected churn (customers you thought were healthy churn)
- You're flying blind on customer health
- You have 50+ accounts and can't manually track everyone

**Why first**: Health scoring is the foundation. You can't prevent churn, drive expansion, or manage renewals if you don't know who's at risk.

---

### 2. Start with Churn Prevention IF:
- You're losing customers regularly (>10% annual churn)
- Churn is your #1 revenue problem right now
- You have SEA customers who go silent before churning

**Why first**: Stopping the bleeding is more urgent than growth. Retained customers = foundation for expansion.

---

### 3. Start with Onboarding IF:
- New customers are churning during/shortly after onboarding
- Time-to-value is 60+ days (should be 30 days or less)
- Activation rates are below 60%

**Why first**: Fix the top of the funnel before optimizing retention/expansion. New customers who don't activate never reach renewal.

---

### 4. Start with Expansion IF:
- Retention is solid (churn <5%) but growth is flat
- Customers are outgrowing your current offering
- You see power users but can't systematically convert → revenue

**Why first**: You've proven retention, now unlock growth. Expansion revenue is the highest-margin revenue.

---

### 5. Start with Renewals IF:
- Renewal timing is the main issue (not churn itself)
- You have complex multi-stakeholder renewals
- Renewals are unpredictable (60-day surprises)

**Why first**: If renewals are stressful but not failing (yet), systematize them before they become a retention problem.

---

## Industry-Specific Pain Patterns

### SaaS Companies (B2B Software)
**Common Pattern**: High scores in Health Monitoring + Expansion

**Why**:
- Product usage data available but not analyzed → AI opportunity
- Expansion potential (feature tiers, seats, modules) but missed opportunities

**Recommended Path**:
1. Health Scoring (foundation)
2. Expansion Identification (unlock growth)
3. Churn Prevention (optimize retention)

---

### Professional Services (Agencies, Consulting)
**Common Pattern**: High scores in Renewals + QBR

**Why**:
- Relationship-based renewals require personalization
- QBRs are critical but time-intensive
- Annual contracts = renewal pressure

**Recommended Path**:
1. QBR Automation (immediate time savings)
2. Renewal Workflows (systematize the process)
3. Health Monitoring (proactive relationship management)

---

### E-Commerce / Marketplace (B2B Platforms)
**Common Pattern**: High scores in Churn Prevention + Expansion

**Why**:
- Churn happens quickly (customers switch platforms easily)
- Expansion = merchants upgrading plans or increasing GMV
- SEA markets = relationship-heavy retention

**Recommended Path**:
1. Churn Prevention (stop leakage)
2. Health Monitoring (identify at-risk merchants)
3. Expansion (grow wallet share)

## Still Not Sure? Common Situations

### "All my scores are LOW (0-10 per section)"
**What this means**: CS is working well, or you have <10 accounts

**Recommendation**:
- If <10 accounts: Manual CS is fine, revisit when you hit 20-30 accounts
- If 10-50 accounts: Your CS is strong! Focus on growth (sales, marketing)
- Consider [Expansion & Upsell](guides/04-expansion-upsell.md) to unlock revenue from happy customers

---

### "All my scores are HIGH (15+ per section)"
**What this means**: CS is overwhelmed, systemic issues

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate**: Start with Health Monitoring (foundation for everything else)
- **Week 2**: Add Churn Prevention (stop the bleeding)
- **Week 4**: Add Onboarding (fix the top of funnel)
- This is a 12-week full transformation, not a quick fix

---

### "My team won't adopt AI tools"
**What this means**: Change management challenge

**Recommendation**:
- Start with one workflow that has a visible time-saving win (QBR prep)
- Let one person pilot, show results to team
- See [FAQ: Team Adoption](FAQ.md#team-adoption) for strategies

---

### "I don't have budget for any AI tools"
**What this means**: Resource-constrained

**Recommendation**:
- Start with Claude Free (limited but functional)
- Focus on highest-ROI workflow: Health Monitoring or Churn Prevention
- Calculate retained revenue from one saved customer = pays for tools 10-50x over

---

### "We operate in markets outside SEA"
**What this means**: Country-specific guidance won't all apply

**Recommendation**:
- Core AI workflows apply globally (health scoring, QBRs, etc.)
- Skip [CULTURAL-CS.md](CULTURAL-CS.md) or adapt principles to your markets
- WhatsApp/LINE sections may not apply (use your local channels)
