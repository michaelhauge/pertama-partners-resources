## QBR Best Practices

### Timing
- **When**: 90 days after contract start, then every 90 days
- **Exceptions**:
  - At-risk accounts: 60-day check-ins (not quarterly)
  - SMB accounts: Semi-annual (every 6 months) OK
  - Strategic accounts: Quarterly mandatory

### Who to Invite
- **Minimum**: Champion (day-to-day contact)
- **Ideal**: Champion + Executive Sponsor
- **Expanded** (for enterprise): Multiple stakeholders, end users

### Meeting Length
- **SMB**: 30 minutes (quick version)
- **Mid-market**: 45-60 minutes (standard)
- **Enterprise**: 60-90 minutes (comprehensive + discussion)

### Preparation
- Send deck 24-48 hours before meeting (let them review)
- Include pre-read summary (1-page)
- Confirm attendees 1 week before
- Run AI analysis 2-3 days before (fresh data)

### During the Meeting
- Let THEM talk (50%+ of time)
- Ask open questions: "What's working well?", "What can we improve?"
- Take notes (use Fireflies.ai or Otter.ai to transcribe)
- Confirm next steps before ending

### After the Meeting
- Send summary within 24 hours
- Action items with owners and timelines
- Schedule next QBR (put on calendar now)

## Common QBR Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Product Feature Dump
**What happens**: QBR becomes "here are all our new features!"

**Western approach**: Feature-focused presentation
**AI-first approach**: Customer value-focused (features mentioned only as they solve customer problems)

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Generate QBR for [COMPANY]. Focus on THEIR wins and value delivered (not our product features). Only mention features when explaining how we solved THEIR problem."
```

---

### Mistake #2: No Quantified Value
**What happens**: Generic "we hope you're happy!" with no ROI

**Western approach**: Qualitative updates
**AI-first approach**: Quantified outcomes (time saved, efficiency gained, costs reduced)

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "For each goal, quantify progress with specific metrics. If no quantified data available, calculate estimated value based on usage patterns."
```

---

### Mistake #3: One-Way Presentation (No Discussion)
**What happens**: CSM talks for 45 min, customer checks out

**Western approach**: Present entire deck
**SEA approach**: Collaborative discussion (50% listen, 50% present)

**Best Practice**: Use deck as guide, pause for discussion, ask open questions

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Cultural Communication Styles
**What happens**: SG-style direct QBR in Indonesia feels pushy

**Western approach**: One deck template for all
**SEA approach**: Adapt tone, pacing, metrics intensity by country

**AI Solution**:
```
Prompt: "Adapt this QBR for [COUNTRY]. Tone: [SG: direct / MY/ID/TH: warm / VN: practical / PH: friendly]. Frame metrics: [SG: ROI-heavy / MY/ID/TH: relationship-first]."
```

---
