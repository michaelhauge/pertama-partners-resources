## SILENT CHURN SIGNALS (SEA-Specific)

Detected signals ranked by severity:

🔴 **Critical Signals**:
1. [SIGNAL — e.g., "No response to last 3 WhatsApp messages over 7 days"]
   - In [COUNTRY], this means: [CULTURAL INTERPRETATION]
   - Churn correlation: [X%] of accounts with this pattern churn

2. [SIGNAL]
   - In [COUNTRY], this means:
   - Churn correlation:

🟡 **Warning Signals**:
1. [SIGNAL — e.g., "Response time increased from 2h → 48h"]
   - In [COUNTRY], this means:

2. [SIGNAL]
   - In [COUNTRY], this means:

---

## ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS

**Why customer is going silent** (even though not complaining):

Primary reason:
- [PRODUCT NOT WORKING / CHAMPION CHANGED / PRIORITIES SHIFTED / VALUE UNCLEAR / AVOIDING CONFRONTATION]

Evidence:
- [BEHAVIORAL DATA SUPPORTING HYPOTHESIS]

**Cultural note**: In [COUNTRY], customers avoid:
- Direct confrontation: [YES — won't say "we're unhappy"]
- Appearing unknowledgeable: [YES — won't admit struggling]
- Damaging relationship: [YES — easier to disengage than complain]

---

## INTERVENTION STRATEGY (CULTURALLY-APPROPRIATE)

**Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)**:

**Step 1: Face-Saving Outreach**

Channel: [WHATSAPP / LINE — not formal email]

Draft message:
```
Hi [NAME],

Hope you're well! I wanted to check in — it's been a while since we last connected.

[IF PATTERN OBSERVED]: I noticed [OBSERVATION — gently stated, not accusatory].

How is [PRODUCT] working for your team? Is there anything we can help with?

Would love to catch up briefly if you have 15 min this week.

[YOUR NAME]
```

Tone: Warm, patient, non-confrontational

**Step 2: Alternative Channel (if no response)**

If no WhatsApp response in 48 hours:
- Try: [EMAIL / PHONE CALL / LINKEDIN MESSAGE]
- Frame: Partnership check-in (not "why are you ignoring us")

**Step 3: Stakeholder Diversification**

If champion unresponsive:
- Reach out to: [EXECUTIVE SPONSOR / OTHER STAKEHOLDER]
- Frame: "Want to ensure we're supporting [COMPANY] well. Haven't heard from [CHAMPION] recently — is everything OK?"

**Step 4: Escalation (if 7+ days no response)**

- Internal: Flag account as CRITICAL RISK
- External: Executive-level outreach from your manager

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Intervention successful if:
- ✅ Customer responds within 48-72 hours
- ✅ Schedules call to discuss status
- ✅ Engagement returns to normal levels

Re-churn risk if:
- 🔴 No response after multiple touchpoints (7+ days)
- 🔴 Responses remain minimal/polite but disengaged
- 🔴 Avoids scheduling call

---

**OUTPUT**: Silent churn risk analysis with culturally-adapted intervention plan.
```

---

### Expected Output
- Silent churn risk level specific to SEA cultures
- Behavioral pattern analysis (response time, message quality, engagement)
- SEA-specific signal interpretation (what silence means)
- Root cause hypothesis considering cultural avoidance of confrontation
- Face-saving intervention strategy

**Time saved**: 20 min analysis → 3 min AI analysis (critical for SEA markets)

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

**If usage is declining**:
1. Proactive check-in: "How is [PRODUCT] working for you?"
2. Identify blockers: "What's preventing more usage?"
3. Training offer: "Would a refresher on [FEATURE] help?"

**If usage is low but stable**:
1. Feature nudges: "Have you tried [HIGH-VALUE FEATURE]?"
2. Use case expansion: "I notice you're using [FEATURE A] — [FEATURE B] would complement it"

**If usage is healthy**:
1. Expand to advanced features
2. Identify expansion opportunity (more seats, higher tier)

---

**OUTPUT**: Deep dive on product usage dimension only (not full health analysis).
```

## Framework 5: Weekly Batch Health Scoring

### Use Case
Automate weekly health score refresh for all accounts (or segment of accounts).

### AI Prompt

```
Batch health analysis for [NUMBER] accounts.

**Input data** (CSV or structured format):
[PASTE CSV WITH COLUMNS: Company, Active Users, Login Frequency, Response Rate, Tickets, Engagement Score, etc.]

For each account, generate:

1. **Health Score** (0-100)
2. **Trend** (IMPROVING / STABLE / DECLINING)
3. **Churn Risk** (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL)
4. **Top Risk Factor** (one dimension causing most concern)
5. **Recommended Action** (one immediate action to take)

**Output as CSV**:
```
Company, Health Score, Trend, Churn Risk, Top Risk, Action
[COMPANY A], 85, Stable, Low, None, Monitor
[COMPANY B], 62, Declining, Medium, Low usage, Proactive check-in
[COMPANY C], 42, Declining, High, Ghosting, Immediate outreach + escalation
...
```

**Prioritization**:
- Flag all accounts with Health <60 for immediate CSM attention
- Flag all accounts with "Declining" trend for proactive check-in

**SEA Cultural Flags**:
- For MY/ID/TH accounts: Flag any "Declining" engagement as higher risk (silent churn)
- For SG/PH accounts: Trust direct communication (if health score green, likely OK)

---

**OUTPUT**: CSV with health scores + actions for all accounts in batch.
```

---

### Expected Output
- Batch processed health scores for entire portfolio
- CSV format ready to upload to CRM
- Automatic prioritization of at-risk accounts
- Country-specific risk adjustments

**Time saved**: 5 hours manual scoring (100 accounts) → 15 min AI batch + review

---

## Country-Specific Health Adjustments

### Singapore: Trust Direct Signals

**Adjustment**:
- Weight engagement higher (they'll tell you if there's a problem)
- Lower weight on "silence" (busy ≠ churn in SG)
- Metrics-driven threshold: Health <70 = intervene

---

### Malaysia/Indonesia: Weight Silence Heavily

**Adjustment**:
- Engagement decline = RED FLAG (not yellow)
- Response time increase >24h = immediate intervention
- "Busy" excuses = potential churn signal
- Threshold: Health <75 = intervene (earlier than SG)

---

### Thailand: Face-Saving Lens

**Adjustment**:
- Polite disengagement = highest risk
- Never ask "Are you unhappy?" (they'll say no even if yes)
- Behavioral signals only (words unreliable)
- Threshold: Health <75 = intervene

---

### Vietnam: Results-Focused

**Adjustment**:
- ROI clarity most important dimension
- If value unclear, health at risk (even if usage OK)
- Practical intervention approach
- Threshold: Health <70 = intervene

---

### Philippines: Balance Direct + Relationship

**Adjustment**:
- They'll communicate issues (like SG)
- But relationship matters (like MY/ID)
- Hybrid approach: Trust signals + relationship maintenance
- Threshold: Health <70 = intervene

---
