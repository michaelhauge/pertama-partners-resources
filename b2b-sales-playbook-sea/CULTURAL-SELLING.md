# Cultural Guide to B2B Selling in Southeast Asia

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-07
**Purpose**: Country-by-country selling strategies for SG, MY, ID, TH, VN, PH

## Why Culture Matters in SEA B2B Sales

Western sales training assumes:
- Direct communication ("Tell me your budget")
- Individual decision-makers
- Fast yes/no decisions
- Transaction over relationship

**This doesn't work in most of Southeast Asia.**

Understanding cultural differences is not "soft skills" - it's **the difference between closing and losing deals**.

TOO INDIRECT (for Singapore):
"Perhaps when the timing aligns better with your strategic initiatives, we might explore potential synergies..."

BETTER (Singapore):
"Are you interested in moving forward with this? If yes, let's discuss next steps. If not, happy to stay in touch for future."
```

**Language**:
- English is standard
