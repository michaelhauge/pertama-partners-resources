# AI-Powered Proposal Writing for SEA B2B Sales

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-07
**Setup Time**: 2-3 hours (initial template setup), 2-3 hours per proposal
**Expected ROI**: Reduce proposal time from 2-3 days → 2-3 hours, faster response = higher win rate

---

## The Problem

Proposals are critical in B2B sales, yet they're often the bottleneck:

❌ **2-3 days to write** - Research company, draft custom sections, internal reviews
❌ **Inconsistent quality** - Junior reps write generic proposals, senior reps write great ones
❌ **Miss timing windows** - Buyer goes cold while waiting for proposal
❌ **Manual research** - 2-4 hours researching company before writing
❌ **Pricing complexity** - Multi-currency SEA pricing (SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, VND, PHP)
❌ **Internal bottlenecks** - Legal, finance, management reviews slow everything down

**Result**: You lose deals not because your solution isn't good, but because you're too slow or your proposal is generic.

## AI Proposal Generation Workflow

### Step 1: AI Company Research (10 minutes)

**Use this before writing any proposal**:

**Prompt for Claude/ChatGPT**:

```
Research [COMPANY NAME] for a B2B proposal. I'm proposing [YOUR SOLUTION - 1 sentence].

Provide a proposal research brief:

## Company Overview
- Business model (1 sentence)
- Size (employees, revenue if public)
- Industry and market position
- Recent developments (last 6 months - funding, launches, expansions, challenges)

## Pain Points (Based on Discovery)
[PASTE YOUR DISCOVERY CALL NOTES HERE]

Based on these notes, identify:
- Top 3 pain points they explicitly mentioned (with quotes)
- Business impact they quantified
- Success metrics they care about

## Proposal Positioning
Based on their pain points, recommend:
1. Which pain point to lead with in Executive Summary (most urgent/quantified)
2. How to frame ROI (time savings, revenue impact, cost reduction, risk mitigation)
3. Key stakeholders to address in proposal (from discovery notes)
4. Potential objections to pre-emptively address

## Competitive Intelligence
- Solutions they currently use (from discovery)
- What they liked/disliked about alternatives they've evaluated
- How to differentiate from their status quo

## Cultural Context
- Country: [SG/MY/ID/TH/VN/PH]
- Communication style recommendations for proposal tone
- Decision-making culture (consensus vs top-down)

Keep this brief - it should take 5 minutes to read before writing proposal.
```

**Example Output**:

```
COMPANY: Tokopedia (Indonesia)
SOLUTION: AI-powered merchant onboarding automation

## Company Overview
- Business model: E-commerce marketplace (200k+ merchants)

- Market: Largest marketplace in Indonesia
- Recent: Expanded to 200+ cities (2025), raised $350M

## Pain Points (from Discovery)
1. "Merchant onboarding takes 2-3 weeks, we want under 1 week" (Sarah, Head of Ops)
   Impact: Losing 30-40% of interested merchants who go to competitors
2. "Operations team spends 40+ hours/week on manual contract generation"
   Impact: Can't scale without hiring more ops people
3. "Document verification is bottleneck - manual review of IDs, licenses"
   Impact: Delays, errors, merchant complaints

## Proposal Positioning
Lead with: Merchant onboarding time (most urgent, quantified)
ROI framing:
- Primary: Speed (2-3 weeks → under 1 week = 2-3x faster onboarding)
- Secondary: Cost (save 40 hours/week ops time = $2,400/mo savings)
Key stakeholders: Sarah (ops), GrabFood Head (her boss), Finance (cost savings)
Pre-empt: "Will this work with our existing merchant systems?" (integration question)

## Competitive Intelligence
Current: Manual process + spreadsheets
Evaluated: None (greenfield opportunity)
Differentiation: Speed + automation vs status quo manual process

## Cultural Context
Indonesia: Relationship-first, consensus-driven
Tone: Warm, consultative, emphasize partnership

### Step 2: AI Executive Summary (10 minutes)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this proposal research:
[PASTE RESEARCH FROM STEP 1]

Write an Executive Summary for a B2B proposal (200-250 words):

Structure:
1. Opening: Acknowledge their specific business situation and challenge (1-2 sentences)
2. The Problem: State the pain in their words (quote from discovery if possible)
3. Our Solution: High-level how we solve it (1-2 sentences, not detailed)
4. The Impact: Quantified value (use their metrics from discovery)
5. Next Steps: What we're proposing (implementation timeline)

Tone:
- Appropriate for [COUNTRY] business culture
- Confident but not arrogant
- Partnership-focused, not vendor-customer
- Use "we" and "together" (collaborative language)

DO NOT:
- Use generic language ("leading provider", "world-class", etc.)
- Make claims without evidence from their discovery call
- Dive into product features (save for later sections)

Quote their pain directly where possible (builds credibility).
```

**Example Output**:

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Tokopedia is scaling at an incredible pace - 200+ cities and 200,000+ merchants in Indonesia alone. This rapid growth has created an operational challenge: merchant onboarding, which currently takes 2-3 weeks, is becoming a bottleneck. As Sarah Wijaya (Head of Merchant Operations) shared, "We're losing 30-40% of interested merchants who go to competitors because our onboarding is too slow."

The core issue is manual processes: document verification, contract generation, and system setup each require significant ops team time (40+ hours/week). With ambitious expansion plans, this manual approach doesn't scale without dramatically increasing headcount.

We're proposing an AI-powered merchant onboarding system that automates document verification, contract generation, and system provisioning - cutting onboarding time from 2-3 weeks to under 1 week. This means:
• 2-3x faster merchant activation (reducing drop-off from 30-40% to <10%)
• 40 hours/week operations time savings ($2,400/month in freed capacity)
• Support for 2x growth without adding ops headcount

We propose a phased 8-week implementation starting with pilot (10 merchants), then scaling to full deployment. Our team will work closely with Sarah's operations team throughout to ensure smooth integration with existing merchant systems.

This proposal outlines how we'll achieve these outcomes together.
```

**Human Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Does it mention specific pain from their discovery call?
- [ ] Are numbers accurate (don't let AI make up metrics)?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for their culture?
- [ ] Does it feel personalized, not templated?

**Time**: 5 min AI generation, 5 min human review and personalization

---

### Step 3: AI Problem Statement (5 minutes)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this proposal research:
[PASTE RESEARCH]

Write a "Problem Statement" section for the proposal (150-200 words):

Structure:
1. Current State: Describe their current process (from discovery notes)
2. Pain Points: List 2-3 specific challenges (use their words/quotes)
3. Business Impact: Quantify the cost of not solving this (from discovery)
4. Why Now: What's driving urgency (expansion, budget cycle, etc.)

Tone: Empathetic, not accusatory
- Frame as "challenges" not "failures"
- Show you understand their situation
- Build case for change

Use their exact language when describing pain (builds credibility that you listened).
```

**Example Output**:

```
THE CHALLENGE

Tokopedia's merchant onboarding process currently involves three manual stages:

1. Document Verification: Operations team manually reviews merchant IDs, business licenses, and bank details (average 3-4 days per merchant)
2. Contract Generation: Each merchant contract is created individually from templates, requiring legal review (2-3 days)
3. System Setup: Merchant accounts, payment rails, and catalog setup are configured manually (1-2 days)

This manual approach creates several challenges:

"Merchant onboarding takes 2-3 weeks. We're losing 30-40% of interested merchants who go to competitors because our process is too slow." - Sarah Wijaya, Head of Merchant Operations

The operations team is spending 40+ hours per week on contract generation alone, limiting their capacity to onboard new merchants. With Tokopedia's expansion to 200+ cities and ambitious growth targets, this manual process is unsustainable without dramatically increasing headcount.

The business impact:
• 30-40% merchant drop-off during onboarding (competitors activate in 3-5 days)
• $2,400/month in operations team time spent on manual contract work
• Scaling constraints: Adding 1,000 merchants/month would require 3-4 additional ops hires

With Q2 expansion plans accelerating, solving this onboarding bottleneck is urgent.
```

**Human Review**: Verify all quotes and numbers are accurate from discovery.

---

### Step 4: AI Solution Section (15 minutes)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this proposal research:
[PASTE RESEARCH]

Write a "Proposed Solution" section (300-400 words):

Structure:
1. Solution Overview: High-level what we're proposing (2-3 sentences)
2. How It Works: 3-4 key capabilities that solve their pain points
   - For each: Feature → Benefit → Impact (on their specific pain)
3. Why This Works: Address their unique situation
4. Differentiation: Why this vs their current approach or alternatives

For each feature, tie directly to a pain point from discovery.

DO NOT:
- List every feature (only ones relevant to their pain)
- Use technical jargon without context
- Make generic claims

Focus on THEIR outcomes, not OUR features.
```

**Example Output**:

```
PROPOSED SOLUTION

We're proposing an AI-powered merchant onboarding platform that automates document verification, contract generation, and system provisioning - reducing onboarding time from 2-3 weeks to under 1 week while maintaining quality and compliance.

## How It Works

**1. AI Document Verification**
Instead of manual review, AI automatically validates merchant IDs, business licenses, and bank details against Indonesia's regulatory databases (NPWP, NIB, etc.).

Impact on Tokopedia:
• Document verification: 3-4 days → 2-4 hours
• Reduces ops team time spent on verification by 90%
• Flags only high-risk cases for human review

**2. Automated Contract Generation**
AI generates merchant contracts from approved templates, customized with merchant details (business structure, commission rates, payment terms).

Impact on Tokopedia:
• Contract creation: 2-3 days → 30 minutes
• Frees 40 hours/week of ops time (your current bottleneck)
• Legal-approved templates ensure compliance

**3. System Provisioning**
Once verified and contracted, merchant accounts are auto-created in Tokopedia's systems (merchant portal, payment rails, catalog access).

Impact on Tokopedia:
• Setup time: 1-2 days → 1-2 hours
• Eliminates manual data entry errors
• Merchants can start listing products same-day

**4. Integration with Existing Systems**
Platform integrates with your current merchant database, payment systems, and catalog management - no replacement of existing tools.

Impact on Tokopedia:
• No disruption to current operations
• Ops team continues using familiar tools
• API-based integration (4-6 week implementation)

## Why This Approach Works for Tokopedia

Your rapid expansion (200+ cities) means traditional "hire more people" approach isn't sustainable. This solution scales with merchant volume - whether you onboard 100 or 10,000 merchants/month, the ops time stays constant.

Unlike generic automation tools, this platform is purpose-built for marketplace merchant onboarding and includes Indonesia-specific regulatory checks (NPWP validation, NIB verification).
```

**Human Review**:
- Verify technical claims are accurate
- Ensure integration points mentioned are real
- Add any client-specific customization

### Step 5: AI Implementation Plan (10 minutes)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this proposal:
[PASTE SOLUTION SECTION]

Create an Implementation Timeline (200-250 words):

Structure:
1. Phase 1: Pilot (describe scope, timeline, success criteria)
2. Phase 2: Scale (rollout plan, training, go-live)
3. Phase 3: Optimization (post-launch support, iteration)

For each phase:
- Duration
- Key activities
- Deliverables
- Success metrics
- Who's involved (our team + their team)

Tone: Realistic, not overpromising
- Show you've thought through details
- Address potential concerns (e.g., "We'll train your team")
- Build confidence this will work

Total timeline: [X weeks] - based on their urgency from discovery.
```

**Example Output**:

```

### Step 6: Pricing (30-60 minutes - HUMAN ONLY)

**CRITICAL: Never let AI create your pricing strategy.**

AI can format pricing, but **human judgment** determines:
- Price point based on value
- Discount strategy
- Payment terms
- Currency choice

**Multi-Currency SEA Pricing Template**:

```
INVESTMENT

## Pricing Structure

**Platform License**:
- [CURRENCY] [AMOUNT] per month
- Includes: [List what's included]
- Unlimited [seats/merchants/transactions up to X]

**Implementation**:
- One-time: [CURRENCY] [AMOUNT]
- Includes: Integration, configuration, training, 8-week deployment

**Ongoing Support**:
- Included in platform license
- 24/7 technical support
- Dedicated account manager
- Monthly optimization reviews

## Total Investment

Year 1: [CURRENCY] [AMOUNT]
  - Implementation: [AMOUNT]
  - Platform (12 months): [AMOUNT]

Year 2+: [CURRENCY] [AMOUNT]/year
  - Platform license only

## Payment Terms

- Implementation: 50% on contract signing, 50% on go-live
- Platform license: Monthly or annual (10% discount for annual prepay)
- Currency: [SGD/MYR/IDR/THB/VND/PHP] or USD

## ROI Analysis

Based on your current costs:
- Operations time savings: 40 hours/week × 4 weeks × $15/hour = $2,400/month
- Merchant drop-off reduction: 30% → 10% = [X] additional merchants/month
- Time to value: Payback in [X] months from ops savings alone

Investment: [AMOUNT]/year
Return: $28,800/year (ops savings) + [merchant revenue impact]
ROI: [X]% annually
```

**Currency Guidance by Country**:
- **Singapore**: SGD or USD (both accepted)
- **Malaysia**: MYR (preferred) or USD
- **Indonesia**: IDR (preferred for local companies) or USD (for subsidiaries of multinationals)
- **Thailand**: THB (preferred) or USD
- **Vietnam**: USD (most B2B deals)
- **Philippines**: USD or PHP

**Pricing Psychology for SEA**:
- Always include ROI analysis (especially VN, ID)
- Offer payment plans (cash flow sensitive markets)
- Annual discounts work well (10-15%)
- Avoid aggressive discounting (devalues solution)

---

### Step 7: Final Sections (AI-Assisted)

**About Us / Why Choose Us** (AI can draft):

**Prompt**:

```
Write a brief "Why Choose Us" section (150 words):

Include:
- Relevant experience (e.g., "Worked with 50+ marketplaces in SEA")

- Team credentials
- Support and partnership approach

Tone: Confident but humble, partnership-focused

DO NOT: Generic claims, overpromising, comparisons to competitors
```

**Terms & Conditions** (Use your legal template - DO NOT let AI write contracts)

**Next Steps** (AI can draft):

```

---

### Design Guidelines

**Singapore**: Clean, professional, minimal design
- Use charts and graphs (data-driven culture)
- PDF format preferred

**Malaysia/Indonesia**: Warmer design, relationship focus
- Include team photos (builds trust)
- Emphasize partnership language throughout

**Thailand**: Respectful, formal presentation
- Use formal titles when referencing their team
- May want printed copy for senior stakeholders

**Vietnam**: ROI-heavy, practical
- Emphasize numbers, cost savings, payback period
- Simple formatting (content > design)

**Philippines**: Professional but approachable
- English fluency high - use industry terminology appropriately
- Both PDF and slide deck formats work

---

## Common Proposal Mistakes (and Fixes)

### Mistake 1: Generic proposals

**Problem**: Copy-paste previous proposal, change company name

**Fix**: Every proposal should reference:
- Specific pain from discovery (use quotes)
- Their metrics and goals
- Their stakeholders by name
- Their competitive situation

**AI help**: AI can personalize IF you provide good discovery notes

---

### Mistake 2: Feature dump

**Problem**: List every feature your product has

**Fix**: Only include features that solve THEIR pain
- Discovery revealed 3 pain points? Address those 3.
- Irrelevant features = noise

**AI help**: AI "Proposed Solution" prompt filters to relevant features

---

### Mistake 3: Weak ROI

**Problem**: "This will save you time" (vague)

**Fix**: "Based on your 40 hours/week on contracts at $15/hour, this saves $2,400/month"
- Use their numbers from discovery
- Quantify savings in their currency

**AI help**: AI can calculate IF you provide numbers from discovery

---

### Mistake 4: Overpromising timelines

**Problem**: "We can implement in 2 weeks" (unrealistic)

**Fix**: Realistic timeline based on:
- Complexity of their environment
- Their team availability
- SEA pace (add 20-60% to Western timelines)

**AI help**: AI suggests realistic timeline IF you tell it country/complexity

---

### Mistake 5: Wrong tone for culture

**Problem**: Aggressive Western sales tone in Indonesia proposal

**Fix**: Adjust tone by country:
- SG: Professional, efficient, data-driven
- MY/ID: Warm, partnership-focused, relationship language
- TH: Respectful, formal, hierarchy-aware
- VN: Practical, ROI-focused, straightforward
- PH: Professional but friendly

**AI help**: AI adjusts tone IF you specify country in prompts

---

### Payment Terms by Country

**Singapore**:
- Standard: Net 30
- Accepts: Monthly subscription
- Currency: SGD or USD

**Malaysia**:
- Standard: Net 30-45
- Prefers: Quarterly invoicing
- Currency: MYR preferred
- Note: GIRO common for recurring payments

**Indonesia**:
- Standard: Net 45-60 (longer payment cycles)
- Prefers: Milestone-based payments

- Note: Price-sensitive market, ROI must be clear

**Philippines**:
- Standard: Net 30
- Prefers: Monthly
- Currency: USD or PHP
- Note: Similar to US payment terms

---

### Contract Considerations

**All SEA Markets**:
- Include termination clauses (longer notice periods accepted)
- Auto-renewal: Specify clearly (some countries require opt-in)
- Data privacy: Reference local DPA laws (PDPA in SG/MY/TH)
- Liability caps: Expected and negotiated

**Indonesia-Specific**:
- Materai (stamp duty) required on contracts >IDR 1M
- Some companies need Indonesian language version
- Local entity may be required for certain contracts

**Thailand-Specific**:
- Respectful negotiation expected (don't pressure)
- Senior stakeholder sign-off needed (be patient)
