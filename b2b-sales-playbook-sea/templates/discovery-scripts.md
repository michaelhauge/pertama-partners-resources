- Company: [COMPANY NAME]
- Contact: [NAME] - [TITLE]
- Industry: [INDUSTRY]

```

---

### OPENING (0-5 minutes)

**Greeting & Rapport**

```
[YOU]: Hi [NAME], great to connect! How's your day going so far?

[PROSPECT]: [Response]

[YOU]: [Respond warmly to their answer - if busy: "I appreciate you making time", if good: "Glad to hear it"]

[AI PERSONALIZATION POINT]:
Mention something specific from research:
- Recent company news: "I saw that [COMPANY] just [ACHIEVEMENT] - congratulations on that!"
- Mutual connection: "By the way, [MUTUAL CONNECTION] speaks highly of you"
- Industry trend: "I've been following [INDUSTRY TREND], must be an exciting time in [INDUSTRY]"
```

**Set Agenda** (respectful, not assuming)

```
[YOU]: Thanks again for taking the time today. I'd love to learn more about [SPECIFIC AREA RELATED TO YOUR SOLUTION] and understand how you're currently handling [SPECIFIC PROCESS].

From there, we can see if what we do might be helpful for your team. Does that sound good?

[PROSPECT]: [Yes / That works / etc.]

[YOU]: Great. I've set aside [45/60] minutes - does that still work for you, or do you have a hard stop?
```

**Why this works**:
- Asks permission (respectful in SEA cultures)
- Sets expectation (learning, not pitching)
- Checks their time (shows respect)

---

### COMPANY & ROLE UNDERSTANDING (5-15 minutes)

**Goal**: Build trust, validate research, understand their world

```
[YOU]: To start, can you tell me a bit about your role? What does a typical week look like for you?

[AI PERSONALIZATION]:
If you know their role: "You're Head of [X] - I'm curious, what takes up most of your time in that role?"
If growing team: "I saw you're hiring for [ROLES] - what's driving that growth?"
If new to role: "How long have you been in this role? What were you doing before?"

[PROSPECT]: [Describes their role and responsibilities]

[YOU]: [ACTIVE LISTENING] That's interesting - so it sounds like you spend a lot of time on [X].
How much of your time is spent on [AREA RELATED TO YOUR SOLUTION]?

[PROSPECT]: [Response]

[YOU]: And out of all those things you mentioned, what do you wish you could spend less time on?

[PROSPECT]: [Response - listen for pain points]
```

**Validate Research** (shows you prepared)

```
[YOU]: Before our call, I did some research on [COMPANY]. I saw that [SPECIFIC FINDING FROM RESEARCH].
How is that impacting your team day-to-day?

[AI PERSONALIZATION EXAMPLES]:
- "I saw you're expanding to [NEW MARKETS]"
- "I noticed you're hiring for [ROLES]"
- "I read about [PRODUCT LAUNCH / FUNDING / NEWS]"

[PROSPECT]: [Describes impact]

[YOU]: [FOLLOW-UP] What would change if that problem was solved?
```

---

### PAIN DISCOVERY (15-35 minutes - CORE OF DISCOVERY)

**Goal**: Uncover business impact, quantify pain, find urgency

**Opening the Pain Conversation**

```
[YOU]: You mentioned [PAIN THEY HINTED AT EARLIER]. Can you tell me more about that? What's happening specifically?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes problem]

[YOU]: [FOLLOW-UP LADDER - Use this sequence]:

Level 1 (Understand): "Help me understand - what does that look like day-to-day?"

Level 2 (Quantify): "How much time/money/resources does that consume?"
                     OR "How often does this happen?"

Level 3 (Impact): "What's the business impact? How does this affect [revenue/customers/team]?"

Level 4 (Urgency): "What happens if this doesn't get solved in the next 6-12 months?"

[Keep digging until you get quantified answers or they signal you've hit the limit]
```

**AI-Generated Pain Questions** (Use your pre-call research)

**Prompt to generate these**:

```
Based on this research:
[PASTE RESEARCH]

Generate 5 pain discovery questions that:
1. Are specific to this company (mention something you learned)
2. Open-ended (can't be answered yes/no)
3. Lead to quantification
4. Are appropriate for [COUNTRY] business culture

Format: Question → Why you're asking → Follow-up if shallow answer
```

**Example Questions (for any B2B deal)**:

```
Q1: "Walk me through what happens when [SPECIFIC PROCESS RELATED TO YOUR SOLUTION]. From start to finish."

Why: Understand their current process, identify bottlenecks
Follow-up: "Where do things typically slow down or break in that process?"

---

Q2: "You mentioned [PAIN FROM EARLIER]. How is your team handling that today? What's the workaround?"

Why: Understand current state, see if workaround is sustainable
Follow-up: "What doesn't work about that workaround?"

---

Q3: "If I could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [PROCESS] tomorrow, what would it be?"

Why: Get them to prioritize pain points, dream about solution
Follow-up: "What's preventing that from happening today?"

---

Q4: "How does [THIS PROBLEM] impact your [team/revenue/customers]?"

Why: Quantify business impact, not just operational annoyance
Follow-up: "Can you put a number on that? (hours/week, deals lost, etc.)"

---

Q5: "Have you tried other solutions to fix this?"

Why: Understand buying stage, what they've learned, what didn't work
Follow-up: "What did you learn from those attempts? What was missing?"
```

**Cultural Adjustments by Country**:

```
SINGAPORE:
- More direct questions OK
- Quantify ROI explicitly: "How much revenue/cost is this impacting?"

MALAYSIA/INDONESIA:
- More indirect approach
- Instead of "What's the problem?", ask "What would you like to improve?"
- Build relationship before pushing on painful topics

THAILAND:
- Respect hierarchy - if senior person on call, let them lead
- Don't make anyone lose face by highlighting failures
- Frame as "opportunities to improve" not "problems"

VIETNAM:
- ROI-focused questions appreciated
- "What's the cost of this problem?" is OK
- Price sensitivity is high - address value early

PHILIPPINES:
- More Western-style discovery OK
- English fluency high - use industry jargon appropriately
- Balance relationship with efficiency
```

---

### CURRENT STATE & SOLUTIONS (35-40 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand competitive landscape, buying stage

```
[YOU]: What tools or systems does your team use today for [PROCESS]?

[PROSPECT]: [Lists current tools]

[YOU]: What works well about [TOOL]? What frustrates your team?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes gaps]

[YOU]: Have you looked at other solutions to streamline this process?

[PROSPECT]: [Yes - describes / No - not actively looking]

[IF YES]:
[YOU]: What did you learn from those evaluations? What did you like, what was missing?

[IF NO]:
[YOU]: What would need to happen for this to become a priority to solve?
```

---

### BANT QUALIFICATION (40-45 minutes)

**Goal**: Qualify without being too direct (SEA-adapted)

**Budget (Indirect Approach)**

```
[YOU]: How do technology investments typically get prioritized at [COMPANY]?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes process]

[YOU]: For a tool focused on [YOUR SOLUTION AREA], would that fall under your budget, or would it be a shared decision?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes budget ownership]

[YOU]: [IF SHARED] Who else would typically be involved in that budget discussion?
```

**Authority (Stakeholder Mapping)**

```
[YOU]: Beyond yourself, who else would care about improving [PROCESS]? Who would be impacted by changes?

[PROSPECT]: [Lists stakeholders]

[YOU]: How do cross-functional projects like this typically get approved at [COMPANY]?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes approval process]

[YOU]: [VALIDATE] So it sounds like [STAKEHOLDER SUMMARY] - is that right?
```

**Timeline (Understand Decision Drivers)**

```
[YOU]: Is there a specific event or timeline driving when you'd want to have a solution in place?
       (e.g., new fiscal year, product launch, scaling plans, etc.)

[PROSPECT]: [Describes timeline or says "not sure"]

[IF TIMELINE EXISTS]:
[YOU]: What needs to happen before that [DATE/EVENT] to make that realistic?

[IF NO TIMELINE]:
[YOU]: What would make this a priority? What would need to change?
```

---

### VISION & NEXT STEPS (45-55 minutes)

**Goal**: Get buy-in on vision, propose next step

**Vision of Success**

```
[YOU]: If we fast-forward 6 months and this problem is solved, what does success look like for you and your team?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes vision]

[YOU]: How would you measure that success? What metrics would tell you it's working?

[PROSPECT]: [Describes success metrics]
```

**Transition to Next Step** (If Qualified)

```
[YOU]: Based on what you've shared - [PAIN SUMMARY] - it sounds like we might be able to help with [SPECIFIC VALUE].

[IF STRONG QUALIFICATION (16+ BANT score)]:
[YOU]: Would it make sense for me to put together a brief overview specific to [THEIR SITUATION]?
       We could schedule 20-30 minutes next week to walk through how we've helped companies like [SIMILAR COMPANY] solve [SIMILAR PAIN].

[IF MODERATE QUALIFICATION (12-15 BANT score)]:
[YOU]: I'd love to send you some information about how we've tackled [PAIN] with other [INDUSTRY] companies.
       After you've had a chance to review, we could reconnect if it looks interesting?

[IF WEAK QUALIFICATION (8-11 BANT score)]:
[YOU]: It sounds like you're still in the early stages of thinking about this.
       Would it be helpful if I sent over some resources about [TOPIC], and we could check back in [TIMEFRAME]?
```

**Handling "I need to think about it"** (SEA Common Response)

```
[PROSPECT]: "This is interesting. Let me think about it / discuss with my team."

[YOU]: Absolutely, makes sense. A few questions to help me understand:

1. "What specifically would you like to think about?" [Uncover real objection]
2. "Who would you need to discuss this with?" [Identify stakeholders]
3. "When do you think you'll have that conversation?" [Get timeline]
4. "What would need to come out of that conversation for you to move forward?" [Understand decision criteria]

[Then propose next step]:
[YOU]: How about this - I'll send you [SPECIFIC RESOURCE], and let's reconnect [SPECIFIC DATE] after you've had a chance to discuss. Does that work?
```

---

### CLOSE (55-60 minutes)

**Recap & Confirm Next Steps**

```
[YOU]: Just to make sure I captured everything correctly:

You shared that:
- [PAIN POINT 1 with quantification]
- [PAIN POINT 2 with quantification]
- [KEY STAKEHOLDERS involved]
- [TIMELINE or lack thereof]

And our next step is [SPECIFIC ACTION with DATE].

Did I miss anything?

[PROSPECT]: [Confirms or corrects]

[YOU]: Perfect. I'll [COMMITMENT - send proposal / send info / schedule follow-up] by [DATE].

Is there anything else I should know before our next conversation?
```

**Warm Close** (SEA-Appropriate)

```
[YOU]: Thank you so much for your time today, [NAME]. I really enjoyed learning about [COMPANY] and the work you're doing with [SPECIFIC PROJECT/AREA].

I'll follow up with [COMMITMENT] by [DATE], and feel free to reach me at [EMAIL / WHATSAPP if appropriate] if anything comes up before then.

Looking forward to connecting again soon!
```

**Why this works**:
- Warm and appreciative (relationship-focused)
- Specific commitment (not vague "I'll be in touch")
- Opens door for their questions
- Not pushy or aggressive

```

---

---

## AI Personalization Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Personalized Questions (Before Call)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this research:
Company: [NAME]
Industry: [INDUSTRY]
Country: [COUNTRY]
Contact: [NAME] - [TITLE]
Key findings: [3-5 BULLETS FROM RESEARCH]

Personalize the universal discovery script:

1. Opening: What specific achievement or news should I mention to show I've researched them?
2. Pain Discovery: What are 3 industry-specific or company-specific pain points to probe for?
3. Current State: What tools/competitors are they likely using?
4. BANT: What's the typical budget/approval process in [INDUSTRY] in [COUNTRY]?

Keep personalization concise (2-3 sentences per section).
```

---

### Step 2: During Call (Use Script as Guide, Not Teleprompter)

**Tips**:
- Have script open, but don't read verbatim
- Listen actively - follow interesting threads
- Use script to get back on track if conversation wanders
- Check off sections as you go to track time

---

### Step 3: Post-Call (Generate Follow-Up)

**Prompt**:

```
Based on this discovery call:
[PASTE NOTES OR TRANSCRIPTION]

Generate:
1. Key pain points we discussed (with quotes)
2. BANT-SEA scores (1-5 for each)
3. Recommended next step
4. Draft follow-up email (150-200 words, appropriate for [COUNTRY] culture)
```

---

## Common Script Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)

### Mistake 1: Reading the script verbatim

**Why it fails**: Sounds robotic, not conversational

**Fix**:
- Read script multiple times before call
- Internalize the flow, not the exact words
- Use bullet points, not full sentences

---

### Mistake 2: Sticking to script when prospect goes off-topic

**Why it fails**: Miss important insights, seem inflexible

**Fix**:
- Follow interesting threads
- Use "That's interesting - tell me more"
- Use script to return to structure after exploration

---

### Mistake 3: Not adjusting for SEA cultures

**Why it fails**: Western scripts too direct, create discomfort

**Fix**:
- Add relationship building time (SG: 2-3 min, ID: 5-10 min)
- Use indirect questions ("How do decisions get made?" vs "Do you decide?")
- Listen for soft nos (politeness masking disinterest)

---

### Mistake 4: Skipping quantification

**Why it fails**: Can't build ROI case, can't prioritize deals

**Fix**:
- Always ask: "Can you quantify that?" or "How often does this happen?"
- Follow up vague answers: "Help me understand the impact"
- Use ladder: Understand → Quantify → Impact → Urgency

---

## Scripts for Common Situations

### Cold Discovery (No Prior Relationship)

**Opening adjustment**:

```
[YOU]: Hi [NAME], thanks for taking my call. I know we haven't connected before, so I really appreciate your time.

[Briefly explain why you're calling - mutual connection, saw their profile, etc.]

I'd love to learn about [AREA] at [COMPANY]. Would it be OK if I asked you a few questions?

[If yes, proceed with script]
[If hesitant, add]: "This isn't a sales pitch - I'm genuinely curious about [INDUSTRY/CHALLENGE], and your perspective would be really valuable."
```

---

### Warm Discovery (Referred by Mutual Connection)

**Opening adjustment**:

```
[YOU]: Hi [NAME], great to connect! [MUTUAL CONNECTION] speaks highly of you - they mentioned you'd be a great person to talk to about [TOPIC].

[Rest of opening as normal, but leverage the connection throughout]
```

---

### Discovery After Demo Request ("Reverse Discovery")

**Opening adjustment**:

```
[YOU]: Thanks for your interest in [PRODUCT]! Before I show you a demo, would it be OK if I asked a few questions?

I want to make sure I show you the parts that are most relevant to your situation, rather than a generic walkthrough.

[Then use discovery script to qualify before showing demo]
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Download and customize** these scripts for your industry and solution
2. **Practice with a colleague** - get comfortable with the flow
3. **Use AI to personalize** for each prospect (10 min before call)
4. **Test on 3-5 discovery calls** - track what works
5. **Refine and share** - create team script library
