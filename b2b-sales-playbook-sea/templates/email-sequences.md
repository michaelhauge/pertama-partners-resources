### Email 2: "Need to Think About It"

**Subject**: Re: [SOLUTION] for [COMPANY]

```
Hi [FIRST NAME],

Makes sense — big decisions take time.

To help you think through it, here are the 3 key questions:

1. **Is the problem big enough?**
   - You mentioned [PAIN POINT: e.g., "9-month sales cycles costing you $1M in lost deals"]

2. **Is this the right solution?**
   - [PROOF POINT: e.g., "We've helped 20+ B2B teams in SEA cut cycles 50%"]

3. **Is now the right time?**
   - You mentioned [GOAL: e.g., "hitting $10M ARR by year-end"]
   - Waiting [N] months = [CONSEQUENCE: e.g., "$250K in lost deals"]

Any other factors you're weighing?

Happy to discuss.

[YOUR NAME]
```

**AI Personalization Prompt**:
```
Prospect said "need to think about it." Generate a helpful email.

Context:
- Their pain point: [e.g., long sales cycles]
- Their goal: [e.g., hit $10M ARR]
- Our proof point: [e.g., helped 20+ companies]

Frame as 3 questions to help them decide. Helpful tone, not pushy.
```

### Email 3: "Not the Right Time"

**Subject**: When would be the right time?

```
Hi [FIRST NAME],

Understood — timing matters.

When would be a better time to revisit?

A few options:
- [ ] Q2 (after [MILESTONE: e.g., "you close Series A"])
- [ ] Q3 (after [MILESTONE: e.g., "new VP Sales starts"])
- [ ] Next year (after [MILESTONE])

I'll check back then.

In the meantime, feel free to reach out if anything changes.

## Pro Tips for AI Email Personalization

### 1. Feed AI Context About the Prospect

Before generating any email, give Claude/ChatGPT this context:

```
Company: [NAME]
Industry: [e.g., fintech, e-commerce]
Size: [e.g., 100 employees, $10M ARR]
Recent trigger: [e.g., raised $15M Series B, hired VP Sales]
Pain point: [e.g., 9-month sales cycles, low win rates]
Your solution: [e.g., AI-powered sales system]
```

**Better AI output = better context input.**

---

### 2. Test Multiple AI Versions

Generate 2-3 versions with different tones:

```
Prompt: "Generate 3 versions of this email:
- Version 1: Professional, formal
- Version 2: Friendly, casual
- Version 3: Direct, concise (under 60 words)

Pick the best for my audience."
```

---

### 3. Use AI to A/B Test Subject Lines

```
Prompt: "Generate 5 subject line options for this email.
Make them:
- Short (under 50 characters)
- Specific (not generic)
- Curiosity-inducing

Rank them by likely open rate."
```

**Example output**:
1. "Quick question about sales cycles at [COMPANY]" (best)
2. "How [COMPETITOR] cut cycles 55% in SEA"
3. "15-min chat about [PAIN POINT]?"
4. "[FIRST NAME], saw you're hiring AEs"
5. "Re: Proposal for [COMPANY]"
