## Data Analysis (CSV, Excel, Datasets)

### Only Choice: ChatGPT Plus (Advanced Data Analysis)

**Why ChatGPT**:
- Only consumer AI that executes Python code
- Upload CSV/Excel → automatic analysis
- Generates charts and visualizations
- Statistical insights without coding

**No competitors**: Claude and Gemini cannot execute code in consumer plans

**Example Analysis Workflow**:

1. **Upload** sales CSV file
2. **Prompt**: "Analyze quarterly trends, identify top products, forecast next quarter, create visualizations"
3. **ChatGPT**:
   - Writes Python code (pandas, matplotlib)
   - Runs code automatically
   - Shows results: charts, statistics, insights
   - Generates forecast

**Sample Output**:
```
I've analyzed your sales data:

Key Findings:
- Revenue grew 23% Q3 to Q4
- Product A accounts for 42% of revenue (over-concentration risk)
- Customer retention rate: 67% (industry avg: 55%)

Forecast Q1 2026: $127K (±15% confidence interval)

[Shows 3 charts: trend line, product mix pie chart, forecast graph]

Recommendations:
1. Diversify product portfolio (reduce Product A dependency)
2. Target lapsed customers (33% churn)
3. Inventory planning for forecasted demand
```

**Cost**: $20/month (ChatGPT Plus)

**Limitations**:
- Dataset size limit (~100MB)
- Python only (no R, SQL)
- Can't access external APIs

**Alternatives for Technical Users**:
- Python + API (any model) - more control
- Business Intelligence tools (Tableau, Power BI) - more features

**Winner**: ChatGPT Plus is only consumer option for data analysis

## Academic Research

### Best Choice: Perplexity Pro

**Why Perplexity for Academics**:
- Citations essential for academic work
- Academic focus mode (prioritizes scholarly sources)
- Good at finding papers, studies, statistics
- Can handle complex research questions

**Academic Research Example**:

**Prompt**: "What's the current state of research on AI hallucinations? Include recent papers (2024-2026)"

**Perplexity with Academic Mode**:
```
Recent research on AI hallucinations focuses on three main areas:

1. Detection Methods:
   Chen et al. (2025) proposed self-consistency checking that
   reduced hallucinations by 34% in GPT-4 [1].

2. Root Causes:
   Stanford study (2024) found hallucinations correlate with
   training data gaps and overconfident probability distributions [2].

3. Mitigation Strategies:
   Anthropic's Constitutional AI (2024) shows 42% reduction
   through reinforcement learning with human feedback [3].

Sources:
[1] Chen, L. et al. "Self-Consistency in Large Language Models"
    ICML 2025
[2] Manning, C. et al. "Understanding LLM Hallucinations"
    Nature AI, June 2024
[3] Bai, Y. et al. "Constitutional AI"
    Anthropic Technical Report, Sep 2024
```

**Academic Workflow**:
1. Research question → Perplexity
2. Get citations and summaries
3. Read original papers (click through to sources)
4. Write literature review
5. Use Claude for writing (better prose)

**Cost**: $20/month

Section 14.5 (page 147): Material breach termination (30 days to cure)
Section 14.8 (page 151): Change of control triggers immediate termination right

Key Risks Identified:
1. Broad definition of "material breach" (Section 1.28, page 12)
2. Unilateral termination right for buyer (Section 14.7, page 150)
3. No termination fee cap (Section 14.9, page 152)

Deadlines:
- Regulatory approval: April 15, 2026 (Section 5.1, page 78)
- Due diligence completion: March 1, 2026 (Section 6.2, page 95)
- Closing date: May 30, 2026 or 30 days after approval (Section 7.1, page 112)

**Prompt**: "What are likely trends in AI for small businesses in 2026-2027?"

**ChatGPT Output**:
```
Based on current developments (Feb 2026):

1. AI Agents for Workflows (High Confidence)
   - Tools like n8n, Zapier adding AI decision-making
   - SMEs will automate complex workflows (not just simple tasks)
   - Market: AI workflow automation growing 45% YoY

2. AI-Native CRM (Medium Confidence)
   - CRMs with built-in AI for email drafting, lead scoring
   - Likely: Salesforce, HubSpot bundle AI features
   - Pricing: $30-50/user/month (up from $20-30 today)

3. Voice AI for Customer Service (Medium Confidence)
   - Phone AI agents handling tier-1 support
   - Cost: 80-90% cheaper than human agents
   - Risk: Customer pushback if not disclosed

4. [More trends with confidence levels]

Weak Signals to Watch:
- AI code generation for no-code tools
- Multimodal AI for visual quality control
- AI compliance assistants (EU AI Act coming 2027)

Sources: [Recent articles and reports]
```

**Methodology**:
- Searches recent news and reports
- Identifies current momentum
- Extrapolates based on growth rates
- Adds caveats and confidence levels

## Research Quality Checklist

Before trusting AI research:

**Verify Sources**:
- [ ] Citations are real (click through links)
- [ ] Sources are authoritative (not random blogs)
- [ ] Publication dates are current
- [ ] Multiple sources confirm claims

**Check for Hallucinations**:
- [ ] Statistics seem reasonable
- [ ] No "made up" references
- [ ] Claims align with known facts
- [ ] Controversial claims have strong citations

**Evaluate Synthesis**:
- [ ] Analysis makes sense
- [ ] Conclusions follow from evidence
- [ ] Nuance is preserved (not oversimplified)
- [ ] Conflicting evidence is acknowledged

**Critical for**:
- Academic papers (verify all citations)
- Business decisions (cross-check data)
- Legal/medical (never rely solely on AI)

## Common Research Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trusting Without Verification

**Problem**: Using AI research without fact-checking
**Impact**: Inaccurate conclusions, credibility damage
**Solution**: Always verify critical claims, especially statistics

### Mistake 2: Using Wrong Tool for Task

**Problem**: Using Claude (no web search) for current events
**Impact**: Outdated information
**Solution**: Use web-enabled tools (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini)

### Mistake 3: No Source Checking

**Problem**: Accepting citations without clicking through
**Impact**: Citing non-existent sources
**Solution**: Click and verify all citations for important work

### Mistake 4: Oversimplifying Complex Topics

**Problem**: AI gives confident but shallow analysis
**Impact**: Missing important nuance
**Solution**: Use AI for overview, read primary sources for depth

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Recency

**Problem**: Not checking publication dates
**Impact**: Outdated information in fast-changing fields
**Solution**: Always specify "current" or "2026" in prompts

---

## Research Best Practices

### 1. Always Specify Time Frame

**Bad**: "What are AI trends?"
**Good**: "What are AI trends in 2026?"

**Why**: Models have knowledge cutoffs, need to search for current info

### 2. Ask for Citations

**Include in prompt**: "Provide citations for all claims"

**Even better**: Use Perplexity (cites automatically)

### 3. Cross-Reference Multiple Sources

**Don't**: Accept first answer
**Do**: Ask follow-up questions, verify with multiple sources

### 4. Use Appropriate Context Window

**For short documents** (<50 pages): Any model
**For medium documents** (50-300 pages): Claude (200K)
**For long documents** (>300 pages): Gemini (2M)

### 5. Combine AI Tools

**Research**: Perplexity → **Analysis**: Gemini/Claude → **Writing**: Claude

Each tool for its strength.
