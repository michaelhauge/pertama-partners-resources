## Debugging Existing Code

### Best Choice: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Why Claude**:
- Best at identifying root causes
- Clear explanations of bugs
- Suggests minimal fixes (doesn't rewrite unnecessarily)
- Good at understanding context from error messages

**Example Debugging Session**:

**User**:
```python
# This function crashes with "list index out of range"
def process_orders(orders):
    for i in range(len(orders)):
        if orders[i]['status'] == 'pending':
            orders[i+1]['processed'] = True
    return orders
```

**Claude Response**:
```
Bug: You're accessing orders[i+1] which will be out of range
on the last iteration.

Root cause: When i = len(orders)-1, i+1 = len(orders) which
doesn't exist.

Fix: You likely want to mark the CURRENT order as processed,
not the next one:

def process_orders(orders):
    for order in orders:  # Simpler iteration
        if order['status'] == 'pending':
            order['processed'] = True
    return orders

Alternative: If you really need to process the NEXT order,
add a bounds check:

if i+1 < len(orders):
    orders[i+1]['processed'] = True
```

**Debugging Workflow**:
1. Paste error message + relevant code
2. Claude identifies root cause
3. Claude suggests fix with explanation
4. You understand WHY it broke (learning)

**vs ChatGPT**: Both good, Claude tends to give clearer explanations

## Code Review and Refactoring

### Best Choice: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Why Claude**:
- Identifies code smells
- Suggests improvements with rationale
- Respects existing patterns
- Doesn't over-engineer

**Example Code Review Prompt**:
```
Review this code for:
1. Bugs or edge cases I missed
2. Performance issues
3. Readability improvements
4. Security vulnerabilities
5. Best practice violations

[Paste code here]
```

**Claude Review Output**:
```
1. Potential SQL injection on line 15 - use parameterized queries
2. N+1 query problem in the loop (lines 22-28) - use batch query
3. Variable name 'x' is unclear - suggest 'user_id'
4. Missing error handling for file operations
5. Consider extracting the validation logic into a separate function

Suggested refactor:
[Shows improved version with explanations]
```

**Refactoring Workflow**:
1. Ask Claude to review code
2. Claude identifies issues with severity (critical, important, nice-to-have)
3. Implement fixes in order of priority
4. Ask Claude to review again (iterative improvement)

## Learning to Code

### Best Choice: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Why Claude**:
- Explains concepts clearly
- Patient with questions
- Good at breaking down complex topics
- Can adjust explanation depth

**Example Learning Session**:

**Beginner**: "Explain what a decorator is in Python"

**Claude**:
```
A decorator is a function that modifies another function's behavior.

Simple analogy: It's like gift wrapping. You have a gift (your function),
and you wrap it (decorate it) to add something extra.

Basic example:
def make_bold(func):
    def wrapper():
        return "<b>" + func() + "</b>"
    return wrapper

@make_bold  # This is the decorator
def greet():
    return "Hello!"

print(greet())  # Output: <b>Hello!</b>

The @make_bold line is syntactic sugar for:
greet = make_bold(greet)

Common use cases:
- Logging (track when functions are called)
- Timing (measure execution time)
- Authentication (check if user is logged in)

Want me to explain any part in more detail?
```

**Progressive Learning**:
1. Start with simple explanation
2. Show concrete example
3. Explain why it's useful
4. Invite questions for deeper dive

**vs ChatGPT**: Both good for learning, Claude tends to be clearer

## Common Coding Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Trusting Code Blindly

**Problem**: Running AI code without reviewing
**Impact**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities in production
**Solution**: Always review, test, and understand code before deploying

### Mistake 2: Copy-Paste Without Understanding

**Problem**: Using code you don't understand
**Impact**: Can't debug when it breaks, can't maintain
**Solution**: Ask AI to explain code, modify it to learn

### Mistake 3: Not Providing Enough Context

**Bad Prompt**: "Write a function to process users"
**Good Prompt**: "Write a Python function that processes User objects from Django ORM, validates email format, and returns list of valid users with type hints"

**More context = better code**

### Mistake 4: Asking for Too Much at Once

**Problem**: "Build entire e-commerce backend"
**Impact**: Low-quality, hard-to-debug code
**Solution**: Break into smaller functions, iterate

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Best Practices

**Problem**: Accepting first output without considering standards
**Solution**: Specify coding standards in prompt

**Example**: "Follow PEP 8, use type hints, include docstrings, handle errors with try/except"

---

## Coding Best Practices with AI

### 1. Iterate, Don't Accept First Output

**Bad workflow**: Generate once → use
**Good workflow**: Generate → test → refine → use

**Refinement prompts**:
- "Optimize for performance"
- "Add error handling for edge case X"
- "Simplify this logic"

### 2. Provide Examples

**Instead of**: "Write a user validation function"
**Do this**: "Write a user validation function like this example: [paste similar code]"

AI learns from examples and matches style.

### 3. Ask for Explanations

**Always ask**: "Explain how this code works"
**Benefit**: You learn, you can debug later

### 4. Test Everything

**Don't trust AI-generated tests either**:
- Write your own tests
- Or review AI tests carefully
- Run tests with edge cases

### 5. Use AI for Boilerplate, Human for Logic

**AI is excellent at**:
- Boilerplate code
- CRUD operations
- Data transformations
- Standard patterns

**Human is better at**:
- Business logic
- Architecture decisions
- Complex edge cases
- Security-critical code
