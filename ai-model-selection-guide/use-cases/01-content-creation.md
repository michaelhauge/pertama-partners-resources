## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Using AI Without Editing

**Problem**: Publishing raw AI output
**Impact**: Generic, potentially inaccurate, obvious AI content
**Solution**: Always edit - treat AI as first draft, not final copy

### Mistake 2: Wrong Model for Task

**Problem**: Using ChatGPT for long-form writing when Claude is better
**Impact**: Lower quality, more editing needed
**Solution**: Use this guide to match model to task

### Mistake 3: No Brand Voice Training

**Problem**: Every piece sounds different
**Impact**: Inconsistent brand voice
**Solution**: Create style guide, include in every prompt

**Example**:
```
Style Guide (include in all prompts):
- Tone: Professional but conversational
- Voice: First person plural ("we"), active voice
- Avoid: Jargon, buzzwords, clichés, exclamation marks
- Include: Concrete examples, statistics, actionable advice
```

### Mistake 4: Ignoring SEO

**Problem**: Great content that doesn't rank
**Impact**: No organic traffic
**Solution**: Research keywords first, include in prompt

### Mistake 5: No Human Review

**Problem**: AI hallucinations published as fact
**Impact**: Credibility damage
**Solution**: Always fact-check, especially for statistics and product claims

## Content Creation Best Practices

### 1. Create Reusable Prompt Templates

**Instead of**: Writing prompts from scratch every time
**Do this**: Create templates for each content type

**Example Blog Post Template**:
```
Write a [length]-word blog post about [topic].

Target audience: [description]
Goal: [awareness/education/conversion]
Tone: [professional/casual/technical]
Include: [specific elements]
Avoid: [things to avoid]
Format: [structure]
```

Save templates in a document, reuse with modifications.

### 2. Build a Style Guide

**Create a document** with:
- Brand voice description
- Example writing samples
- Words to avoid
- Tone guidelines
- Formatting rules

**Include in prompts**: "Follow this style guide: [paste guide]"

### 3. Iterate, Don't Accept First Draft

**Bad workflow**: Generate once → publish
**Good workflow**: Generate → review → refine → edit → publish

**Ask for revisions**:
- "Make this more concise"
- "Rewrite the intro to be more engaging"
- "Add a case study example"

### 4. Combine AI Tools

**Don't limit yourself** to one tool:
- Use ChatGPT for research
- Use Claude for writing
- Use Jasper for SEO optimization
- Use Grammarly for final editing

### 5. Track What Works

**Measure**:
- Time saved vs manual writing
- Quality scores (readability, SEO, engagement)
- Editing time required
- Publishing velocity

**Optimize**: Double down on what works, iterate on what doesn't
