**Test top 2-3 options**:
- ChatGPT Free, Claude Free, Gemini Free
- Try same tasks on each
- Compare quality and features

**Track**:

**If one tool is clearly better**:
→ Upgrade to paid version ($20/month)

**If it's close**:
→ Start with ChatGPT Plus (most versatile)

**If budget allows $40**:
→ Add specialized tool (Claude for writing, Perplexity for research)

### 3. Evaluate ROI (Month 2)

**Ask**:
- How many hours did AI save this month?
- What's my hourly rate?
- Is AI paying for itself?

**Example ROI**:
- Saved 10 hours/month
- Hourly rate: $50/hour
- Value: $500/month
- Cost: $20-40/month
- **ROI: 12-25x positive**

### 4. Optimize (Month 3+)

**Add or remove tools based on usage**:

- Add specialized tools for heavy use cases
- Negotiate team plans if scaling

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based on Hype

**Wrong**: "Everyone uses ChatGPT, so I should too"
**Right**: "What tasks do I actually need AI for? Which tool does those best?"

### Mistake 2: Not Testing Free Tiers First

**Wrong**: Pay for subscription without testing
**Right**: Use free versions for 1-2 weeks, compare, then upgrade

### Mistake 3: Paying for Features You Don't Use

**Wrong**: ChatGPT Team for solo use (waste of admin features)
**Right**: ChatGPT Plus for solo, Team for actual teams

### Mistake 4: Under-Investing in High-ROI Tool

**Wrong**: Staying on free tier when AI saves 10 hours/month
**Right**: Upgrade if ROI positive (saves more than it costs)

### Mistake 5: Not Reassessing After 3 Months

**Wrong**: Set and forget subscription
**Right**: Review usage quarterly, optimize stack

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I switch later if I choose wrong?

**Yes**. All consumer plans are month-to-month, cancel anytime.

**No lock-in**: Try one, switch next month if it's not working.

### Q: Should I pay for multiple tools?

**Depends**. If each tool saves time on different tasks, yes.

**Example**: Claude for writing (10 hrs/month) + Perplexity for research (5 hrs/month) = 15 hours saved for $40 cost. ROI positive if your time is worth >$2.67/hour.

### Q: What if I'm still unsure?

**Default recommendation**: Start with ChatGPT Plus ($20)
- Most versatile
- Easiest to learn
- Covers 80% of use cases
- Switch later if needed
