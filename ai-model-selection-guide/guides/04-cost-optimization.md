## Strategy 1: Smart Tool Selection

### Use Cheaper Models for Simple Tasks

**Problem**: Using GPT-4 for everything

**Example waste**:
- Task: "Fix typo in this sentence"
- Model used: GPT-4o ($2.50/$10 per 1M tokens)
- Better model: GPT-4o mini ($0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens)
- **Savings**: 94% cost reduction

**Rule of thumb**:
- **Complex tasks** (analysis, reasoning, creativity): Use flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Simple tasks** (grammar, formatting, simple Q&A): Use mini/haiku models (GPT-4o mini, Claude Haiku)

**How to implement** (ChatGPT Plus):
- Before sending prompt, ask: "Is this complex or simple?"
- If simple, select "GPT-4o mini" in model dropdown
- If complex, use "GPT-4o"

**Savings**: 30-50% of API costs, or stay under usage limits longer on consumer plans

---

### Budget Model Swaps (API Users)

**Current spending** (GPT-4o for 5M tokens/month):
- Cost: 5M × $7/1M = $35/month

**Budget alternative** (DeepSeek V3):
- Cost: 5M × $1.37/1M = $6.85/month
- **Savings**: $28.15/month (80% reduction)
- Quality: Similar for code generation

**When to swap**:
- Code generation → DeepSeek V3 (90% savings)
- Simple completions → GPT-4o mini (94% savings)
- Complex reasoning → Keep GPT-4o or Claude

**Model substitution guide**:

| Current Model | Task Type | Swap To | Savings |
|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| GPT-4o | Code generation | DeepSeek V3 | 80% |
| GPT-4o | Simple tasks | GPT-4o mini | 94% |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Simple tasks | Claude 3.5 Haiku | 81% |
| GPT-4o | Creative writing | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Better quality, similar cost |
| o1 (reasoning) | Math/logic | DeepSeek R1 | 95% |

## Strategy 2: Prompt Optimization

### Reduce Unnecessary Verbosity

**Before optimization** (250 tokens):
```
I would like you to please help me write a comprehensive and detailed blog
post about the benefits of using artificial intelligence in small businesses.
Please make sure to include at least 5 main points, provide specific examples
for each point, write in a professional but friendly tone, avoid using too
much technical jargon, and make it around 1,500 words in length. Also, please
include an introduction and a conclusion, and make sure the writing flows
naturally. Thank you!
```

**After optimization** (80 tokens):
```
Write a 1,500-word blog post: AI benefits for small businesses.

Include:
- 5 main points with examples
- Intro and conclusion
- Professional but friendly tone
- Minimal technical jargon
```

**Savings**:
- Input tokens: 250 → 80 (68% reduction)
- Cost savings: Depends on volume, but 68% less input cost
- Bonus: Clearer instructions often yield better output

**Optimization techniques**:
1. Remove filler words ("please", "I would like", "make sure to")
2. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
3. Remove redundancy
4. Be direct

---

### Reuse System Prompts (API)

**Inefficient**:
```python
# Every call includes full style guide
prompt = """
You are a professional copywriter. Write in first person plural.
Use active voice. Avoid jargon. Be concise. Include statistics.
[500 token style guide]

Now write a blog post about [topic].
"""
# Pay for 500 tokens of style guide every single call
```

**Optimized**:
```python
# Set style guide once as system message
system = """[500 token style guide]"""

# Only send task in user message
user = "Write a blog post about [topic]."

# Reuse system message across many calls
# Pay for 500 tokens once, amortized across all calls
```

**Savings**: If you make 100 calls/month, save 49,500 tokens (500 × 99 reuses)

---

## Strategy 3: Cancel Unused Subscriptions

### Audit Current Spending

**Common subscription overlap**:
- ChatGPT Plus ($20) + Claude Pro ($20) + Perplexity Pro ($20) = $60/month
- **Question**: Do you use all three equally?

**Audit exercise** (1 week):
1. Track which AI tool you use for each task
2. Count: ChatGPT (___), Claude (___), Perplexity (___)
3. Identify: Which one do you use <5 times/week?

**Decision rule**:
- Used <5 times/week → Cancel (not worth $20/month)
- Used 5-20 times/week → Keep or downgrade to free tier
- Used >20 times/week → Definitely keep

**Typical finding**: 80% of usage on 1-2 tools, 20% on others

**Optimization**:
- Keep top 1-2 tools
- Cancel others or use free tiers
- **Savings**: $20-40/month

---

### Consolidate to One Tool

**Before**:
- ChatGPT Plus ($20) - for research and images
- Claude Pro ($20) - for writing
- **Total**: $40/month

**After** (Option 1: Prioritize versatility):
- Keep ChatGPT Plus ($20) only
- Use for both research and writing
- Accept slightly lower writing quality
- **Savings**: $20/month

**After** (Option 2: Prioritize quality):
- Keep Claude Pro ($20) only
- Use for writing
- Research with free ChatGPT + web search
- **Savings**: $20/month

**When to consolidate**:
- Budget is tight ($20/month max)
- Usage is moderate (<30 prompts/day)
- Quality difference isn't critical

**When to keep multiple**:
- Heavy daily use (50+ prompts/day)
- Each tool has distinct use case
- $40/month is affordable for your budget

---

## Strategy 4: Free Tier Rotation

### For Ultra-Budget-Conscious ($0/month)

**Strategy**: Rotate between free tiers instead of paying

**Available free tiers**:
- ChatGPT Free: ~15-40 messages/day (GPT-3.5, occasional GPT-4)
- Claude Free: ~10-20 messages/day (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, limited)
- Gemini Free: ~15-50 messages/day (Gemini Pro)
- Perplexity Free: Unlimited (basic model)

**Rotation workflow**:
1. Use ChatGPT Free until daily limit
2. Switch to Claude Free for writing tasks
3. Use Gemini Free if both exhausted
4. Perplexity Free for research (unlimited)

**Limitations**:
- Lower quality models (ChatGPT Free uses GPT-3.5, not GPT-4)
- Message limits frustrating
- No advanced features

**When this works**:
- Casual use (<50 prompts/week)
- Budget is $0
- Willing to deal with limits

**When to upgrade** ($20/month):
- If you hit limits daily
- If AI saves >1 hour/week
- ROI calculation: 4 hours saved/month × $25/hour = $100 value for $20 cost

---

## Strategy 5: API Optimization (For Developers)

### Use Caching (50% Savings)

**Problem**: Re-sending same context every call

**Example** (documentation Q&A):
```python
# Inefficient: Send full 50K token documentation every call
for question in questions:
    prompt = f"{documentation}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
    response = call_api(prompt)  # 50K tokens × 100 questions = 5M tokens
```

**Optimized with caching**:
```python
# Efficient: Cache documentation, only send question
cached_context = cache_prompt(documentation)  # 50K tokens once
for question in questions:
    prompt = f"{cached_context}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
    response = call_api(prompt)  # 50K (cached) + 50 (question) = 5,050 tokens per call
```

**Savings**:
- Before: 5M tokens
- After: 55K tokens
- **Reduction**: 99% (in this extreme example)

**Realistic savings**: 30-70% for most applications

**How to implement**: Use Claude's prompt caching or OpenAI's cached completions

---

### Batch Processing

**Problem**: Making API calls one at a time

**Inefficient**:
```python
for item in 1000_items:
    result = api_call(item)  # 1,000 separate API calls
    # Wait time: 1 sec/call × 1,000 = 17 minutes
```

**Optimized**:
```python
batches = chunk(1000_items, batch_size=10)  # 100 batches of 10
for batch in batches:
    results = api_call(batch)  # 100 API calls
    # Wait time: 1 sec/call × 100 = 1.7 minutes
```

**Savings**:
- Time: 90% reduction (17 min → 1.7 min)
- Cost: 10-20% (fewer API overhead tokens)

---

### Reduce Output Tokens

**Inefficient prompt**:
```
Write a detailed, comprehensive analysis of this code.
```

**Response**: 2,000 tokens (very verbose)

**Optimized prompt**:
```
Analyze this code. List only critical issues in bullet points.
```

**Response**: 300 tokens (concise)

**Savings**: 85% fewer output tokens

**Technique**: Add "Be concise" or "Respond in 3 sentences or less"

---

## Strategy 6: Workflow Optimization

### Pre-Filter Tasks (Use AI Only When Necessary)

**Problem**: Using AI for tasks that don't need it

**Examples of wasted AI usage**:
- Spell checking → Use Grammarly (cheaper/free)
- Simple calculations → Use calculator
- Formatting text → Use text editor find-and-replace
- Translating → Use Google Translate (free)

**Rule**: Only use AI for tasks that require reasoning, creativity, or natural language understanding

**Savings**: 20-40% of prompts eliminated

---

### Iterate Locally, Finalize with AI

**Inefficient workflow**:
1. Ask AI to write draft
2. Ask AI to revise draft
3. Ask AI to revise again
4. Ask AI to revise again
5. (4-5 prompts per piece)

**Optimized workflow**:
1. Ask AI to write draft
2. Edit manually
3. Ask AI to refine final draft
4. (2 prompts per piece)

**Savings**: 50% fewer prompts

---

## Strategy 7: Team Optimization

### Share Subscriptions Appropriately

**Inefficient** (10-person team):
- Everyone has individual ChatGPT Plus ($20 × 10 = $200/month)
- No admin visibility
- People use <10 times/month

**Optimized**:
- 5 heavy users: ChatGPT Plus ($20 × 5 = $100/month)
- 5 light users: Free tier (rotate as needed)
- **Savings**: $100/month

**Alternative (if need admin controls)**:
- ChatGPT Team ($25/user × 10 = $250/month)
- Benefit: Admin dashboard, higher limits, analytics
- Cost: +$50/month vs individual Plus, but better value

---

### Centralize Expertise

**Problem**: Everyone experiments independently, wasting time

**Solution**: Train 1-2 "AI champions"
- Champions learn best practices
- Create prompt templates for common tasks
- Team uses templates (higher quality, less iteration)
- Reduce wasted prompts by 30-50%

---

## Common Costly Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Tracking Usage

**Problem**: "I feel like I'm using AI a lot"
**Reality**: Use 5 times/month = $4/use on $20 subscription

**Solution**: Track usage for 1 month, then decide

---

### Mistake 2: Using Premium for Everything

**Problem**: GPT-4 for "Fix this typo"
**Impact**: 94% more expensive than GPT-4o mini

**Solution**: Match model to task complexity

---

### Mistake 3: Iterating Too Much with AI

**Problem**: 5 revisions via AI prompts
**Impact**: 5× the cost

**Solution**: Edit drafts manually, use AI for 1-2 passes max

---

### Mistake 4: Paying for Features You Don't Use

**Problem**: ChatGPT Team ($25/user) for solo user
**Impact**: Paying for admin features you can't use

**Solution**: Choose plan that matches team size
