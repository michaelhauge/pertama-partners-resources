## Cost Examples

### Content Creator (Heavy Video User)

**Usage**: Analyze 50 hours of video/month for content summaries

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Value |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Gemini Advanced | $20 | Unlimited within usage caps, 2M context |
| Gemini API (1.5 Pro) | ~$12 | 50 hours = ~10M tokens input |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20 | Would need to split videos (128K limit) |

**Calculation**: 50 hours × 200K tokens/hour = 10M tokens input
(10M × $1.25/1M) = $12.50 API cost

**Winner**: Gemini Advanced for simplicity, API if high volume

### Google Workspace Team (10 people)

**Usage**: 5 people use Gemini in Gmail/Docs daily, 5 occasionally

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Workspace Business | $144 | $12/user × 12 months ÷ 12 = $12/mo baseline |
| Gemini add-on | Included | No extra cost for Gemini features |
| 10× Gemini Advanced | $200 | If not using Workspace |

**Winner**: Workspace + Gemini (included) saves $200/month vs standalone
