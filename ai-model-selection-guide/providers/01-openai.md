### Use Cases Where ChatGPT Plus Excels

#### 1. Research & Web Search

- Uses Bing to search recent articles
- Synthesizes information from multiple sources
- Provides up-to-date answers (unlike base model)

**Cost vs Alternatives**:
- Perplexity Pro: $20/month (dedicated research tool, better citations)
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month (research + everything else)

#### 2. Data Analysis
**Example**: Upload sales CSV → "Show me quarterly trends and forecast next quarter"
- Automatically writes Python code to analyze data
- Generates charts and visualizations
- Provides statistical insights

**No Code Required**: ChatGPT writes and executes Python for you

#### 3. Image Generation
**Example**: "Create a professional logo for a coffee shop called 'Bean There'"
- Generates 4 variations
- Can iterate based on feedback
- Commercial use allowed

**vs Midjourney**: DALL-E 3 is easier for beginners, Midjourney has better artistic quality

#### 4. Document Analysis
**Example**: Upload 50-page contract → "Summarize key terms and risks"

## ChatGPT Team

**Price**: $25/user/month (annual billing) or $30/month (monthly)
**Minimum**: 2 users

### Team vs Plus

| Feature | Plus | Team | Enterprise |
|---------|------|------|------------|
| Price | $20/mo | $25/user/mo* | $60/user/mo* |
| Message limits | 80 GPT-4/3hr | Higher limits | Unlimited |
| Admin dashboard | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Usage analytics | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Training on data | Opt-out | ✅ No training | ✅ No training |
| Shared workspace | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| SSO (SAML) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| API credits | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**When to choose Team**:
- ✅ Team of 3-50 people
- ✅ Need admin controls (who's using what)
- ✅ Want to ensure data isn't used for training
- ✅ Share custom GPTs across team

**When Plus is enough**:
- ❌ Solo user or <3 people
- ❌ Don't need admin visibility
- ❌ Can manage individual accounts

## API Usage

### When to Use API vs Consumer Plans

**Use Consumer Plans ($20-60/month) When**:
- ✅ Volume <100K tokens/month (~75K words)
- ✅ Non-technical user (no coding required)
- ✅ Ad-hoc usage (not programmatic)
- ✅ Need web interface, images, file upload

**Use API When**:
- ✅ Volume >100K tokens/month
- ✅ Building custom applications
- ✅ Need specific models (fine-tuning)
- ✅ Require lower latency

### Cost Comparison Example

**Scenario**: Write 20 blog posts/month (2,000 words each = 40,000 words = ~53K tokens)

| Option | Monthly Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| **ChatGPT Plus** | $20 | Simple, no code, unlimited | Can't automate |
| **GPT-4o API** | ~$0.66 | Cheap, can automate | Requires coding |

**Calculation**: (53K input × $2.50/1M) + (53K output × $10/1M) = $0.13 + $0.53 = $0.66

**Winner**: ChatGPT Plus for simplicity (unless you're processing millions of words)
