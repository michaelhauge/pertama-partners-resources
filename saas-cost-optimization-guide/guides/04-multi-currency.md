# Multi-Currency Optimization: The SEA 10-20% Savings Opportunity

## The Hidden Cost of Paying in USD

**Scenario**: Your Singapore company pays for Salesforce in USD.

**Current spend**: USD $100K/year
**Exchange rate**: 1 USD = 1.35 SGD
**Cost in SGD**: SGD $135K/year

**If you switched to SGD pricing**:
**SGD pricing**: SGD $120K/year (vendor offers lower SGD price)
**Cost in USD**: USD $88,889/year
**Savings**: USD $11,111/year (11.1% discount)

**Why this works**: Vendors price differently by region (lower prices in emerging markets + FX hedging benefits).

---

## Why SEA Companies Should Optimize Currency

### Reason 1: Regional Pricing Arbitrage

**How it works**: US SaaS vendors charge different prices in different regions (lower prices in SEA to gain market share).

**Example (Salesforce)**:
- **US pricing**: $150/user/month
- **SGD pricing**: SGD $180/user/month = USD $133/user/month (11% cheaper)
- **MYR pricing**: MYR 550/user/month = USD $125/user/month (17% cheaper)

**Why vendors do this**:
- **Market penetration**: Lower prices help win customers in price-sensitive markets
- **Purchasing power parity**: Adjust prices to local economic conditions
- **Competitive pressure**: Local vendors offer lower prices, so global vendors must compete

---

### Reason 2: FX Hedging Benefits

**How it works**: Vendors hedge FX risk and pass savings to customers who pay in local currency.

**Example**:
- Vendor expects USD/SGD to fluctuate 1.30-1.40 over 12 months
- Vendor hedges at 1.35 (locks in rate)
- Vendor offers SGD pricing that benefits from hedged rate (vs spot rate)
- Customer saves 5-10% vs paying in USD at spot rates

---

### Reason 3: Payment Method Optimization

**How it works**: Some vendors offer discounts for specific payment methods (wire transfer vs credit card, annual prepay vs monthly).

**Credit card fees**: 2-3% (vendors pass this cost to customers)
**Wire transfer**: 0.5-1% (lower cost, some vendors offer 2% discount for wire transfer)

**Annual prepay discount**: 10-15% (vendors prefer cash upfront)

**Example**:
- **Monthly credit card**: $10K/month × 12 = $120K/year
- **Annual wire transfer**: $102K/year (15% discount: 10% annual prepay + 2% wire transfer + 3% avoiding CC fees)

---

### Reason 4: Tax Optimization

**How it works**: Paying in local currency may allow better GST/VAT treatment.

**Example (Singapore)**:
- **USD payment to US vendor**: 9% GST may not be recoverable (depends on vendor registration)
- **SGD payment to local subsidiary**: 9% GST is recoverable (vendor has Singapore entity)
- **Tax savings**: 9% of spend

**See**: [Tax Optimization by Country](#tax-optimization-by-country-sea) below.

---

## Which Vendors Offer Local Currency Pricing?

### Major Vendors with SEA Local Currency Pricing

#### Tier 1: Full SEA Currency Support

**Vendors**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, AWS, Adobe Creative Cloud

**Currencies supported**: SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, VND, PHP

**Typical savings**: 10-20% vs USD pricing

**How to switch**:
- Contact account manager: "We want to switch from USD to [LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing"
- Effective at next renewal (or immediately for monthly subscriptions)

---

#### Tier 2: Partial SEA Currency Support

**Vendors**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoom, Slack, Atlassian

**Currencies supported**: SGD, MYR (some: THB, IDR)

**Typical savings**: 8-15% vs USD pricing

**How to switch**:
- Check vendor pricing page: "Does [VENDOR] offer [CURRENCY] pricing?"
- If yes, request switch from account manager
- If no, stay on USD (or consider alternative vendors)

---

#### Tier 3: USD Only (No Local Currency)

**Vendors**: Most smaller SaaS vendors (<$100M ARR)

**Currencies supported**: USD only

**Optimization strategy**: Negotiate USD pricing (can't switch currency), or use credit cards with favorable FX rates

---

### How to Check if Vendor Offers Local Currency

**Method 1: Check vendor pricing page**
- Go to vendor website → Pricing page
- Look for currency selector (usually top-right corner)
- If local currency appears, vendor offers it

**Method 2: Ask account manager**
```
Subject: Local Currency Pricing — [VENDOR]

Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

We're currently paying in USD. Does [VENDOR] offer [SGD/MYR/IDR/THB/VND/PHP] pricing?

If yes, can you provide a quote in local currency? We're interested in switching at our next renewal ([DATE]).

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

**Method 3: Google search**
- Query: "[VENDOR] SGD pricing" or "[VENDOR] Malaysia pricing"
- Check results for regional pricing pages

---

## How to Switch from USD to Local Currency

### Step 1: Request Currency Switch (60-90 Days Before Renewal)

**Email template**:
```
Subject: Currency Switch Request — USD → [LOCAL CURRENCY]

Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

We're based in [COUNTRY] and currently pay in USD. We'd like to switch to [LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing at our next renewal ([DATE]).

Can you provide:
1. **Current USD pricing**: $[X]/year
2. **Equivalent [LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing**: [CURRENCY] $[Y]/year
3. **Effective FX rate**: 1 USD = [RATE] [CURRENCY]
4. **Savings vs current USD spend**: $[Z]/year

If the savings are meaningful (10%+), we'll switch at renewal.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

---

### Step 2: Compare Pricing (Apples-to-Apples)

**Example (Salesforce)**:

**Current USD pricing**:
- Plan: Enterprise Edition
- Users: 50
- Cost: USD $150/user/month × 50 = USD $7,500/month = USD $90K/year
- Exchange rate: 1 USD = 1.35 SGD
- **Cost in SGD**: SGD $121,500/year

**SGD pricing offered by vendor**:
- Plan: Enterprise Edition
- Users: 50
- Cost: SGD $180/user/month × 50 = SGD $9,000/month = SGD $108K/year
- **Cost in USD**: SGD $108K ÷ 1.35 = USD $80K/year
- **Savings**: USD $10K/year (11.1% discount)

**Decision**: Switch to SGD pricing (11.1% savings).

---

### Step 3: Negotiate the Currency Switch

**Leverage point**: Vendors want to keep you (switching currency is a retention signal).

**Email template**:
```
Subject: SGD Pricing Proposal — [VENDOR]

Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

Thanks for the SGD pricing quote: SGD $108K/year.

This is an improvement over our current USD $90K/year (at current FX rates: SGD $121,500), but I was hoping for better savings.

**Counter-proposal**: SGD $100K/year (17% savings vs current)

Can you work with that? We're committed to [VENDOR] long-term and want to stay, but need the economics to work.

Let me know.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

**Expected response**: Vendor will either accept, counter with SGD $105K, or hold firm at SGD $108K.

**Outcome**: Even if vendor holds firm at SGD $108K, you still save 11.1% by switching currency.

---

### Step 4: Update Contract and Billing

**Actions**:
1. **Sign currency addendum**: Vendor provides updated contract with SGD pricing
2. **Update payment method**: Provide local bank account (if wire transfer) or SGD credit card
3. **Set FX rate** (if applicable): Some vendors fix FX rate for contract term (protects you from FX fluctuations)
4. **Effective date**: Currency switch usually effective at next renewal (or immediately for monthly subs)

---

### Step 5: Monitor FX Risk

**Question**: What if SGD weakens against USD during the contract term?

**Example**:
- Contract signed: 1 USD = 1.35 SGD (SGD $108K/year = USD $80K/year)
- 12 months later: 1 USD = 1.25 SGD (SGD $108K/year = USD $86.4K/year)
- **Result**: You're paying USD $86.4K (vs original $90K), still saving 4%, but less than expected 11.1%

**Mitigation**:
- **Option 1**: Negotiate fixed FX rate for contract term (vendor locks rate at 1.35 for 12-36 months)
- **Option 2**: Accept FX risk (savings still likely, even with FX fluctuations)
- **Option 3**: Hedge FX yourself (forward contracts, options)

---

## Multi-Currency Optimization by Country (SEA)

### Singapore

**Currency**: SGD (Singapore Dollar)

**USD/SGD typical range**: 1.30-1.40 (relatively stable)

**Which vendors offer SGD pricing**:
- ✅ Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, AWS, Adobe, Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoom, Slack, Atlassian, Stripe

**Typical savings**: 8-15% vs USD

**Tax considerations**:
- **GST**: 9% on all SaaS purchases (whether USD or SGD)
- **GST input credit**: Fully recoverable if vendor has Singapore GST registration
- **Tip**: Prefer vendors with Singapore entities (easier GST recovery)

**Payment methods**:
- **Credit card**: 2-3% fees (Visa/Mastercard international transaction fees if paying USD)
- **GIRO/Wire transfer**: 0.5-1% fees (cheaper, vendors may offer 2% discount)
- **Recommendation**: Use wire transfer for large purchases (>$50K/year)

**FX hedging**: Unnecessary for most companies (SGD/USD is stable). For >$500K USD spend, consider forward contracts.

---

### Malaysia

**Currency**: MYR (Malaysian Ringgit)

**USD/MYR typical range**: 4.0-4.5 (volatile, weakening trend)

**Which vendors offer MYR pricing**:
- ✅ Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, AWS, Adobe
- ⚠️ Salesforce, HubSpot (limited MYR support, mostly SGD fallback)
- ❌ Most smaller vendors (USD only)

**Typical savings**: 10-20% vs USD (higher savings due to regional pricing arbitrage)

**Tax considerations**:
- **SST (Sales & Service Tax)**: 6% on foreign SaaS (enforcement inconsistent)
- **Digital services tax**: 6% on foreign digital services (effective 2020+)
- **Tip**: Some vendors don't charge SST (gray area), ask your vendor

**Payment methods**:
- **Credit card**: 3-4% fees (higher than Singapore, foreign transaction fees)
- **Wire transfer**: 1-2% fees (use for large purchases)
- **Recommendation**: Negotiate annual prepay discount (10-15%) to offset CC fees

---

### Indonesia

**Currency**: IDR (Indonesian Rupiah)

**USD/IDR typical range**: 14,000-16,000 (very volatile)

**Which vendors offer IDR pricing**:
- ⚠️ Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, AWS (limited IDR support)
- ❌ Most vendors (USD only, IDR rare)

**Typical savings**: 5-15% vs USD (when IDR pricing available)

**Tax considerations**:
- **VAT**: 11% on foreign SaaS (as of 2022, was 10% previously)
- **Vendor registration**: Foreign vendors must register as digital service providers
- **Tip**: Ensure vendor charges VAT correctly (you can claim input credit)

**Payment methods**:
- **Credit card**: 3-5% fees (high foreign transaction fees)
- **Wire transfer**: 2-3% fees (use for large purchases)
- **Recommendation**: Multi-year USD contracts (lock in USD rate, avoid IDR volatility)

**FX hedging**: Critical for >$100K USD spend (IDR is highly volatile). Use forward contracts or multi-year USD contracts.

---

- **Vendor registration**: Foreign vendors should register for VAT
- **Tip**: Confirm vendor charges VAT correctly

**Payment methods**:
- **Credit card**: 3-5% fees
- **Wire transfer**: 2-3% fees
- **Recommendation**: Use USD (VND pricing rare), negotiate USD discounts instead

## Tax Optimization by Country (SEA)

### Singapore: GST Recovery

**GST rate**: 9% (as of 2023, was 8% in 2022)

**Key principle**: GST is recoverable if vendor has Singapore GST registration.

**How to optimize**:
1. **Check vendor GST status**: Ask "Are you registered for Singapore GST?"
2. **Request GST invoice**: Vendor provides tax invoice with GST number
3. **Claim input credit**: File GST return (quarterly) and claim GST paid as input credit
4. **Net cost**: 0% (GST is fully recoverable)

**What if vendor is NOT Singapore GST registered?**
- **Reverse charge**: You must self-assess and pay 9% GST to IRAS (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore)
- **Claim input credit**: You can still claim it back (if you're GST registered)
- **Net cost**: 0% (still fully recoverable, just more paperwork)

---

### Malaysia: SST Compliance

**SST rate**: 6% (Sales & Service Tax)

**Key principle**: Digital services from foreign vendors are subject to 6% digital services tax (as of 2020).

**How to optimize**:
1. **Check vendor SST status**: Most foreign vendors don't collect SST (gray area)
2. **Confirm pricing**: Ask "Does your pricing include 6% Malaysian SST?"
3. **Budget accordingly**: If vendor doesn't charge SST, you're not required to self-assess (unlike Singapore GST)

**Common scenario**: Most foreign SaaS vendors don't charge Malaysian SST (enforcement is inconsistent).

**Tax savings**: Effectively 6% savings (compared to vendors who do charge SST).

---

### Indonesia: VAT & Withholding Tax

**VAT rate**: 11% (as of 2022, was 10% previously)

**Withholding tax**: None for digital services (foreign vendors must register and collect VAT)

**Key principle**: Foreign vendors must register with Indonesian tax authority (Direktorat Jenderal Pajak) and collect VAT.

**How to optimize**:
1. **Check vendor VAT registration**: Ask "Are you registered for Indonesian VAT?"
2. **Request VAT invoice**: Vendor provides e-Faktur (Indonesian electronic tax invoice)
3. **Claim input credit**: File VAT return (monthly) and claim VAT as input credit
4. **Net cost**: 0% (VAT is recoverable)

**What if vendor is NOT registered?**
- **Your company must self-assess**: Report as "import of services" and pay 11% VAT
- **Claim input credit**: You can claim it back if you're VAT registered
- **Net cost**: 0% (recoverable), but extra paperwork

---

### Thailand: VAT & Withholding Tax

**VAT rate**: 7%

**Withholding tax**: 15% (if vendor has no Thai entity)

**Key principle**: Withholding tax is a BIG problem in Thailand (15% is not recoverable).

**How to optimize**:
1. **Prefer vendors with Thai entities**: They handle VAT, no withholding tax
2. **Negotiate gross pricing**: If vendor has no Thai entity, negotiate "gross price" (vendor absorbs withholding tax)
3. **Use Thai resellers**: Buy through Thai reseller (they handle VAT/WHT)

**Example**:
- **Direct purchase from US vendor**: $100K/year + 15% WHT = $115K effective cost (WHT not recoverable)
- **Purchase from Thai reseller**: $105K/year (reseller marks up 5%, but handles VAT/WHT) = $105K effective cost
- **Savings**: $10K/year (8.7%) by using Thai reseller

---

### Vietnam: VAT

**VAT rate**: 10%

**Key principle**: Foreign vendors should register and collect VAT (but enforcement is weak).

**How to optimize**:
1. **Check vendor VAT status**: Most foreign vendors don't collect Vietnamese VAT
2. **Budget accordingly**: If vendor doesn't charge VAT, you're not required to self-assess
3. **Tax savings**: Effectively 10% savings (if vendor doesn't charge VAT)

---

### Philippines: VAT & Withholding Tax

**VAT rate**: 12% (highest in SEA)

**Withholding tax**: 30% (if vendor has no Philippine entity) — CRITICAL ISSUE

**Key principle**: Philippine withholding tax is the biggest tax trap in SEA (30% is HUGE).

**How to optimize**:
1. **ONLY use vendors with Philippine entities**: Avoid 30% WHT at all costs
2. **Negotiate tax gross-up**: If vendor has no PH entity, negotiate "gross price" (vendor pays the 30% WHT)
3. **Use Philippine resellers**: Buy through PH reseller to avoid WHT

**Example**:
- **Direct purchase from US vendor**: $100K/year + 30% WHT = $130K effective cost (WHT not recoverable)
- **Purchase from Philippine reseller**: $112K/year (reseller marks up 12%, but handles VAT/WHT) = $112K effective cost
- **Savings**: $18K/year (13.8%) by using Philippine reseller

**Caution**: Always confirm vendor has Philippine subsidiary before signing large contracts (30% WHT can destroy your budget).

---

## Payment Method Optimization

### Credit Card vs Wire Transfer

**Credit card fees**: 2-5% (depending on card type, country, vendor)

**Wire transfer fees**: 0.5-2% (bank fees)

**When to use credit card**:
- ✅ Small purchases (<$10K/year) — convenience outweighs fees
- ✅ You want points/rewards (2-3% cashback can offset fees)
- ✅ Vendor doesn't accept wire transfer

**When to use wire transfer**:
- ✅ Large purchases (>$50K/year) — savings exceed hassle
- ✅ Vendor offers 2-3% discount for wire transfer
- ✅ You want to avoid credit card foreign transaction fees (2-3%)

---

### Annual Prepay vs Monthly Billing

**Annual prepay discount**: 10-15% (typical)

**Monthly billing**: 0% discount (but more flexibility)

**When to use annual prepay**:
- ✅ You're confident you'll use the tool for 12 months
- ✅ Cash flow allows (you have $50K-$200K to prepay)
- ✅ Vendor offers 10%+ discount (makes it worthwhile)

**When to use monthly billing**:
- ✅ You're testing the tool (not confident in 12-month commitment)
- ✅ Cash flow constrained (can't afford $50K-$200K upfront)
- ✅ Vendor offers <5% discount (not worth the lock-in)

---

### Local Bank Account vs Foreign Bank Account

**Local bank account** (e.g., Singapore bank for SGD payments):
- ✅ No foreign transaction fees (2-3% savings)
- ✅ Faster transfers (1-2 days vs 3-5 days)
- ✅ Better vendor relationships (vendors prefer local payments)

**Foreign bank account** (e.g., US bank for USD payments):
- ⚠️ Foreign transaction fees (2-3% additional cost)
- ⚠️ Slower transfers (3-5 days)
- ⚠️ FX risk (if USD weakens, you lose purchasing power)

**Recommendation**: Use local bank account for local currency payments (saves 2-3% in fees).

---

## FX Hedging Strategies

### When to Hedge FX Risk

**Hedge if**:
- ✅ USD spend >$500K/year (material FX exposure)
- ✅ Operating in volatile currency (IDR, MYR, PHP, THB)
- ✅ Multi-year contracts in foreign currency (3-year USD contracts when you earn MYR)

**Don't hedge if**:
- ❌ USD spend <$200K/year (not worth the effort)
- ❌ Operating in stable currency (SGD/USD is stable)
- ❌ Annual contracts (FX risk is limited to 12 months)

---

### Hedging Method 1: Forward Contracts

**How it works**: Lock in FX rate for 6-12 months.

**Example**:
- Today: 1 USD = 1.35 SGD
- You have USD $500K in SaaS spend over next 12 months
- You buy forward contract: Lock 1 USD = 1.35 SGD for 12 months
- **Result**: Even if USD/SGD moves to 1.25 or 1.45, you pay 1.35 (locked rate)

**Cost**: 1-2% of contract value (bank fee)

**When to use**: >$500K USD spend, volatile currency (MYR, IDR, PHP, THB).

---

### Hedging Method 2: Multi-Year USD Contracts

**How it works**: Sign 3-year USD contract (lock in USD price for 3 years).

**Example**:
- **Scenario**: Malaysian company, USD $200K/year SaaS spend
- **Risk**: MYR weakens from 4.0 to 4.5 over 3 years (12.5% increase in MYR cost)
- **Mitigation**: Sign 3-year USD contract at $200K/year (USD price fixed)
- **Result**: Even if MYR weakens, USD price stays $200K (you know the cost in advance)

**When to use**: Multi-year contracts, volatile currency.

---

### Hedging Method 3: Natural Hedging

**How it works**: Match currency of revenue with currency of expenses.

**Example**:
- **Scenario**: Indonesian company earns USD revenue (exports), spends USD on SaaS
- **Natural hedge**: USD revenue offsets USD expenses (no FX risk)

**Example 2**:
- **Scenario**: Malaysian company earns MYR revenue, spends USD on SaaS
- **No natural hedge**: MYR revenue doesn't offset USD expenses (FX risk exists)
- **Fix**: Switch SaaS to MYR pricing (where available) to create natural hedge

---

## Case Study: Multi-Currency Optimization in Practice

### Case Study: Singapore SaaS Company ($10M ARR)

**Situation**:
- Total SaaS spend: $500K/year
- All subscriptions in USD
- Exchange rate: 1 USD = 1.35 SGD
- Effective SGD cost: SGD $675K/year

**Actions**:
1. **Switched to SGD pricing** (Google, Microsoft, AWS, Salesforce, HubSpot) → $50K saved
2. **Negotiated multi-year USD contracts** (vendors without SGD pricing) → $30K saved
3. **Switched to wire transfer** (for >$50K purchases) → $10K saved (2% CC fee avoided)
4. **Annual prepay discounts** (where cash flow allowed) → $20K saved

**Results**:
- **Total savings**: $110K/year (22% reduction in SaaS spend)
- **Effort**: 40 hours (10 hours per tactic)
- **ROI**: ($110K ÷ $4K) = 2,750%

---

### Case Study: Malaysian E-Commerce Company ($25M ARR)

**Situation**:
- Total SaaS spend: $1.2M/year
- 80% in USD, 20% in SGD
- Exchange rate: 1 USD = 4.2 MYR
- MYR weakening trend (4.0 → 4.5 over 2 years)

**Actions**:
1. **Switched to MYR pricing** (Google, Microsoft, AWS) → $100K saved (10% regional arbitrage)
2. **Forward contracts** (hedged USD $800K spend for 12 months) → $60K saved (avoided MYR depreciation)
3. **Multi-year USD contracts** (locked in rates for 3 years) → $80K saved (15% multi-year discount + FX protection)
4. **Used Malaysian resellers** (for vendors without MYR pricing) → $40K saved (local pricing + no FX fees)

**Results**:
- **Total savings**: $280K/year (23% reduction in SaaS spend)
- **Effort**: 80 hours (CFO + finance team)
- **ROI**: ($280K ÷ $8K) = 3,500%

## Multi-Currency Optimization Checklist

### Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Export all SaaS subscriptions (see [SaaS Audit Guide](01-saas-audit.md))
- [ ] Identify foreign currency spend (USD, EUR, etc.)
- [ ] Calculate total foreign currency exposure ($X/year)
- [ ] Flag large vendors (>$50K/year each) for currency optimization

---

### Phase 2: Vendor Analysis (Week 3-4)

- [ ] Check which vendors offer local currency pricing (SGD, MYR, etc.)
- [ ] Request local currency quotes from account managers
- [ ] Compare local currency pricing vs current USD pricing (apples-to-apples)
- [ ] Calculate potential savings (10-20% typical)

---

### Phase 3: Negotiation (Week 5-8)

- [ ] Stack leverage points (currency switch + multi-year + competitive pressure)
- [ ] Negotiate gross-up for withholding tax (if applicable, e.g., Thailand, Philippines)
- [ ] Finalize currency switch contracts

---

### Phase 4: Payment Method Optimization (Week 9-10)

- [ ] Switch large purchases (>$50K/year) to wire transfer (save 2% CC fees)
- [ ] Negotiate annual prepay discounts (10-15% typical)
- [ ] Set up local bank accounts (if needed for local currency payments)

---

### Phase 5: FX Hedging (Week 11-12)

- [ ] Assess FX risk (total USD spend, currency volatility)
- [ ] If >$500K USD spend in volatile currency (MYR, IDR, PHP), consider forward contracts
- [ ] If multi-year contracts, lock in USD rates (or use forward contracts)
- [ ] Set up monitoring (quarterly FX risk review)

---

### Phase 6: Tax Optimization (Ongoing)

- [ ] Ensure vendors charge GST/VAT correctly
- [ ] Claim GST/VAT input credits (file quarterly/monthly returns)
- [ ] Avoid withholding tax traps (use vendors with local entities in TH/PH)
- [ ] Work with tax advisor (ensure compliance with local tax laws)

---

## Summary: Multi-Currency Optimization Decision Tree

**Question 1: Does your vendor offer local currency pricing (SGD/MYR/IDR/THB/VND/PHP)?**
- ✅ YES → Request local currency quote, compare with USD pricing (expect 10-20% savings)
- ❌ NO → Skip to Question 2

**Question 2: Is your spend >$50K/year with this vendor?**
- ✅ YES → Negotiate multi-year USD contract (lock in rates, get 15-25% discount)
- ❌ NO → Not worth optimizing (focus on larger vendors)

**Question 3: Are you in a volatile currency market (MYR, IDR, PHP, THB)?**
- ✅ YES → Consider FX hedging (forward contracts if >$500K USD spend)
- ❌ NO (Singapore) → No hedging needed (SGD/USD stable)

**Question 4: Does vendor have a local entity in your country?**
- ✅ YES → Prefer local billing (avoid withholding tax, easier GST/VAT recovery)
- ❌ NO → Check withholding tax risk (especially TH/PH — 15-30% WHT!)

---

## Next Steps

**Step 1**: Complete vendor discovery (identify foreign currency spend) using [SaaS Audit Guide](01-saas-audit.md)
