## Template 1: Initial Competitive RFP (Creating Competitive Pressure)

**When to use**: You're evaluating 2-3 competing vendors and want aggressive pricing from all of them.

**Subject line**: `[COMPANY] RFP — [CATEGORY] Tool Evaluation`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [VENDOR SALES REP],

We're [COMPANY NAME] ($[X]M ARR, [Y] employees) and we're evaluating solutions for [USE CASE].

We're comparing 3 vendors:
- [VENDOR 1]
- [VENDOR 2]
- [VENDOR 3]

We'll make a decision by [DATE] (45 days from now).

Can you provide:
1. **Pricing** for [X] users (annual contract)
   - List price
   - Discounted price (best you can offer)
   - Multi-year pricing (2-3 year commitment)

2. **Demo/trial** (we want to test with [X] users for 14 days)

3. **Case studies** (2-3 companies similar to ours in [INDUSTRY])

4. **Implementation timeline** (how long to get up and running?)

Best overall value wins (pricing + features + support).

Available for intro call:
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 1]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 2]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 3]

Looking forward to your proposal.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]

[COMPANY]
[EMAIL]
[PHONE]
```

**Expected result**: Vendor will offer 20-30% discount (competitive deal pricing).

## Template 2: Contract Renewal (Expiring Contract Leverage)

**When to use**: Your contract is expiring in 60-90 days and you want to renegotiate before renewal.

**Subject line**: `Contract Renewal — [VENDOR] Expires [DATE]`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

Our [VENDOR] contract expires on [DATE] (60 days from now).

We're evaluating whether to:
- Renew with [VENDOR]
- Switch to [COMPETITOR 1] or [COMPETITOR 2]
- Build in-house

**Current contract**:
- Plan: [ENTERPRISE / PROFESSIONAL / etc.]
- Users: [X]
- Annual cost: $[Y]/year
- Contract signed: [DATE]

**What we need to renew**:

1. **Cost reduction**: 20-25% discount (target: $[Z]/year)
   - Justification: We've received competitive quotes 20-30% below our current pricing

2. **Multi-year pricing**: What discount can you offer for a 2-3 year commitment?

3. **New features**: What have you added since we signed? (We want to understand ROI on renewal)

4. **Seat optimization**: We currently have [X] paid seats but only [Y] active users (last 60 days). Can we right-size to [Y] seats?

**Usage analysis**:
- Active users: [Y] (last 60 days)
- Seat utilization: [Z]% (we're paying for unused seats)
- Feature usage: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH] — we're not fully utilizing [FEATURE A, FEATURE B]

Can we schedule a call to discuss renewal terms?

Available:
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 1]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 2]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 3]

If we can't agree on pricing, we'll need to explore alternatives.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 15-25% discount at renewal (vs current pricing).

---

## Template 3: Budget Constraint (Hard Cap Leverage)

**When to use**: You have a hard budget cap and need the vendor to meet it.

**Subject line**: `Budget Approval — [VENDOR] Purchase`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [SALES REP],

Great news: Our CFO approved the [VENDOR] purchase!

**Approved budget: $[X]/year** (hard cap)

Your quote is $[Y]/year, which is [Z]% over budget.

Can you help us close the gap? We're open to:
- **Longer contract** (3 years instead of 1 year)
- **Tier downgrade** (Professional instead of Enterprise) — What features would we lose?
- **Delayed start** (Q2 start instead of Q1) — Does this help with your quota timing?
- **Phased rollout** (start with [X] users, add [Y] more after 6 months)
- **Annual prepay** (pay full year upfront in exchange for discount)

If we can hit $[X], we'll sign by [DATE].

If not, we'll need to either:
- Explore alternatives ([COMPETITOR] quoted us $[X])
- Delay the purchase (wait for next fiscal year)

What's possible?

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 10-15% additional discount to fit within budget.

---

## Template 4: Competitive Quote (Leveraging Competitor Pricing)

**When to use**: You have a quote from Competitor A and want Vendor B to match or beat it.

**Subject line**: `Competitive Comparison — [YOUR VENDOR] vs [COMPETITOR]`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [YOUR VENDOR REP],

We're comparing [YOUR VENDOR] vs [COMPETITOR].

**Your quote**:
- Plan: [PLAN NAME]
- Users: [X]
- Cost: $[Y]/year

**[COMPETITOR]'s quote**:
- Plan: [COMPARABLE PLAN]
- Users: [X]
- Cost: $[Z]/year

**Gap**: [COMPETITOR] is [%]% cheaper and offers [80-90%] comparable features.

**Can you match [COMPETITOR]'s pricing ($[Z]/year)?**

We prefer [YOUR VENDOR]'s product (better features, better integrations), but we can't justify paying [%]% more.

If you can match (or get within 5-10%), we'll go with [YOUR VENDOR].

If not, we'll likely choose [COMPETITOR] based on cost.

Need to decide by [DATE].

Let me know what's possible.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: Vendor will either match or offer 10-20% discount (get closer to competitor pricing).

---

## Template 5: End-of-Quarter Urgency

**When to use**: It's the last 2 weeks of the vendor's fiscal quarter and you want to leverage quota pressure.

**Subject line**: `Sign by [END OF QUARTER DATE] — [VENDOR] Purchase`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [SALES REP],

We're ready to commit to [VENDOR] if the pricing works.

**Our timeline**: Sign by [END OF QUARTER DATE] (we need this in place before [BUSINESS REASON, e.g., "end of fiscal year", "Q4 planning", "new team onboarding"]).

Can you provide your **absolute best pricing** by [DATE ONE WEEK BEFORE EOQ]?

We're looking for:
- **20-25% discount** (we've received competitive quotes and have budget constraints)
- **Multi-year pricing** (willing to commit 2-3 years for additional discount)
- **Net-30 payment terms** (invoice [FIRST DAY OF NEXT QUARTER], pay 30 days later)

**What we bring**:
- Fast decision (sign within 5 days if pricing is right)
- Multi-year commitment (predictable revenue for you)
- Potential expansion (we're growing [X]% annually, will add [Y] users in 12 months)
- Reference customer (happy to do case study, press release if pricing works)

If we can agree on pricing by [ONE WEEK BEFORE EOQ], we'll sign before [END OF QUARTER DATE].

This helps you hit quota, and helps us hit our timeline — win-win.

Let me know what's possible.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 10-20% additional discount (end-of-quarter desperation pricing).

---

## Template 6: Multi-Year Commitment (Long-Term Discount)

**When to use**: You're willing to commit to 2-3 years in exchange for a steep discount.

**Subject line**: `Multi-Year Commitment — [VENDOR] Pricing`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

We're interested in a **2-3 year contract** with [VENDOR] if the pricing makes sense.

**Current pricing**:
- Annual contract: $[X]/year
- Discounted price (your best offer): $[Y]/year

**Multi-year proposal**:
- **3-year commitment**: What discount can you offer?
  - Target: $[Z]/year (20-25% off list price)
  - Total contract value: $[Z] × 3 = $[TOTAL]

**What you get**:
- **Locked-in revenue** for 3 years (predictable ARR)
- **Reduced churn risk** (we're committed for 36 months)
- **Expansion opportunity** (we'll likely grow from [X] to [Y] users over 3 years — upsell potential)

**What we need**:
- **Fixed pricing** for 3 years (no annual increases)
- **Early termination clause** (if we need to exit in Year 2-3, we pay 50% of remaining balance and can leave — not ideal for us, but de-risks the commitment)
- **Seats flexibility** (ability to scale up/down by 20% mid-contract without penalties)

Can we schedule a call to discuss multi-year terms?

Available:
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 1]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 2]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 3]

Looking forward to a long-term partnership.

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 15-25% discount for 2-3 year commitment.

## Template 7: Volume Discount (Consolidating Subscriptions)

**When to use**: You're consolidating multiple team subscriptions into one enterprise account.

**Subject line**: `Volume Pricing — Consolidating [X] Subscriptions`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

We currently have **[X] separate [VENDOR] subscriptions** across different teams:
- Team 1: [Y] users @ $[Z]/month
- Team 2: [Y] users @ $[Z]/month
- Team 3: [Y] users @ $[Z]/month
- **Total**: [TOTAL USERS] users, $[TOTAL COST]/year

We want to consolidate into **one enterprise account** ([TOTAL USERS] users).

**Current total spend**: $[TOTAL COST]/year (paying [X] × list price)

**Target enterprise pricing**: $[TARGET]/year (20-30% volume discount)

**What you get**:
- **Simplified account management** (1 contract instead of [X] contracts)
- **Increased account value** (we're a larger customer now)
- **Expansion potential** (easier to add users when we're on enterprise plan)

**What we need**:
- **Volume discount** (target: $[TARGET]/year for [TOTAL USERS] users)
- **Consolidated billing** (one invoice, not [X] separate invoices)
- **Dedicated CSM** (now that we're a larger account)

Can you provide enterprise pricing for [TOTAL USERS] users?

If we can hit $[TARGET], we'll consolidate by [DATE].

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 10-20% volume discount for consolidated account.

## Template 8: Currency Switch (SEA-Specific: USD → Local Currency)

**When to use**: You want to switch from USD to local currency pricing (SGD, MYR, etc.) to save 10-20%.

**Subject line**: `Currency Switch Request — USD → [LOCAL CURRENCY]`

**Email body**:
```
Hi [ACCOUNT MANAGER],

We're based in [COUNTRY] and currently pay in USD. We'd like to switch to **[LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing** at our next renewal ([DATE]).

**Current USD pricing**:
- Plan: [PLAN NAME]
- Users: [X]
- Cost: USD $[Y]/year
- FX rate: 1 USD = [RATE] [LOCAL CURRENCY]
- **Effective cost in [LOCAL CURRENCY]**: [LOCAL CURRENCY] $[Z]/year

**Questions**:
1. Does [VENDOR] offer [LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing?
2. If yes, what's the **[LOCAL CURRENCY] price** for [X] users?
3. What's the **effective FX rate** you're using? (1 USD = [RATE] [LOCAL CURRENCY])
4. How much would we **save vs current USD pricing**?

**Example calculation**:
- Current: USD $[Y]/year = [LOCAL CURRENCY] $[Z]/year (at spot rate [RATE])
- [LOCAL CURRENCY] pricing: [LOCAL CURRENCY] $[TARGET]/year (vendor regional pricing)
- **Savings**: [LOCAL CURRENCY] $[SAVINGS]/year = USD $[USD SAVINGS]/year (10-20% typical)

If the savings are meaningful (10%+), we'll switch at renewal.

Can you provide a quote in [LOCAL CURRENCY]?

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
```

**Expected result**: 10-20% savings by switching to local currency (SEA regional pricing arbitrage).

**When to use**: You're an existing customer considering adding a new product/module from the same vendor.

**Subject line**: `Renewal + New Product Bundle — Pricing Request`

Can you provide **bundled pricing** for:
1. **[VENDOR PRODUCT 1] renewal** (currently $[X]/year)
2. **[VENDOR PRODUCT 2] new purchase** (quoted at $[Y]/year separately)

**Separate purchases**:
- Product 1 renewal: $[X]/year
- Product 2 new: $[Y]/year
- **Total**: $[TOTAL]/year

**Bundled target**: $[TARGET]/year (20-30% discount vs buying separately)

**What you get**:
- **Expanded account footprint** (we're buying more from [VENDOR], not going to competitors)
- **Multi-year commitment** (willing to commit 2-3 years if bundled pricing works)
- **Predictable revenue** (both products locked in for 24-36 months)

If we can hit $[TARGET], we'll sign both by [DATE].

If not, we'll likely:
- Renew Product 1 at current pricing (no expansion)
- Evaluate alternative vendors for Product 2 (e.g., [COMPETITOR])

Can we schedule a call to discuss bundle pricing?

Available:
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 1]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 2]
- [DATE/TIME OPTION 3]

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]

## Negotiation Workflow: When to Use Each Template

### Phase 1: Initial Evaluation (Week 1-2)

**Use**:
- Template 1: Initial Competitive RFP (send to 2-3 vendors)

**Goal**: Get competitive quotes from multiple vendors.

---

### Phase 2: Negotiation (Week 3-6)

**Use** (depending on your leverage points):
- Template 4: Competitive Quote (if you have competitor pricing)
- Template 6: Multi-Year Commitment (if willing to commit 2-3 years)
- Template 7: Volume Discount (if consolidating subscriptions)
- Template 8: Currency Switch (if in SEA, switching from USD to local currency)
- Template 11: Startup Discount (if early-stage startup)
- Template 12: Early Adopter Discount (if vendor is small/emerging)

**Goal**: Negotiate 20-40% discount by stacking leverage points.

---

### Phase 3: Closing (Week 7-8)

**Use**:
- Template 5: End-of-Quarter Urgency (if vendor's quarter is ending)
- Template 13: Annual Prepay Discount (if you can prepay)
- Template 15: Post-Negotiation Follow-Up (lock in agreed terms)

**Goal**: Close the deal with final discount (30-50% total).

---

### Phase 4: Renewal (60-90 days before expiration)

**Use**:
- Template 2: Contract Renewal (renegotiate before auto-renewal)
- Template 14: Disable Auto-Renewal (take control of renewal timing)

**Goal**: Renegotiate 10-20% discount at renewal (never auto-renew).

---

## Pro Tips for Email Negotiations

### Tip 1: Always Provide Multiple Date/Time Options

**Bad**: "Can we schedule a call?"
**Good**: "Available: [OPTION 1], [OPTION 2], [OPTION 3]"

**Why**: Reduces back-and-forth, shows you're serious.

---

### Tip 2: Use Specific Numbers (Not Ranges)

**Bad**: "We're looking for 20-30% discount"
**Good**: "We need to hit $75K/year (vs your quote of $100K)"

**Why**: Specificity creates urgency and makes negotiation concrete.

---

### Tip 3: Always Mention Alternatives

**Bad**: "Can you give us a discount?"
**Good**: "We've received quotes from [COMPETITOR 1] and [COMPETITOR 2] at 20% lower pricing"

**Why**: Creates competitive pressure (vendors fear losing deals to competitors).

---

### Tip 4: Bundle Leverage Points

**Example**: Stack multiple leverage points in one email:
- Expiring contract (Template 2)
- Multi-year commitment (Template 6)
- End-of-quarter timing (Template 5)
- Reference customer (Template 10)

**Result**: 30-50% total discount (vs 10-20% with single leverage point).

---

### Tip 5: Follow Up Within 24 Hours

**After sending negotiation email**: If vendor doesn't respond in 24 hours, follow up with:
```
Subject: Re: [ORIGINAL SUBJECT]

Hi [VENDOR],

Following up on my email from yesterday. We're on a tight timeline ([DATE] deadline).

Can you provide pricing by [DATE]?

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

**Why**: Shows urgency, keeps negotiation moving.

---

## Next Steps

**Step 1**: Identify which template matches your situation

**Step 2**: Copy template and replace [PLACEHOLDERS] with your details

**Step 3**: Send email to vendor account manager (or sales rep)

**Step 4**: Follow up within 24-48 hours if no response

**Step 5**: Use [Negotiation Tactics Guide](../guides/03-negotiation-tactics.md) for advanced negotiation strategies
