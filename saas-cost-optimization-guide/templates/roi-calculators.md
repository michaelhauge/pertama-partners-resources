### Example: CRM Consolidation

**Current state**:
- Salesforce (Sales): $180,000/year, 100 users
- HubSpot CRM (Marketing): $50,000/year, 25 users
- Pipedrive (CS): $10,000/year, 15 users
- **Total**: $240,000/year, 140 users (some overlap)

**Consolidation plan**:
- Keep: Salesforce (already most expensive, most features)
- Migrate: HubSpot CRM users (25) + Pipedrive users (15) = 40 users to Salesforce
- New Salesforce cost: 140 seats × $150/month = $252,000/year

**Wait, that's MORE expensive!** 🚫

**Revised plan** (negotiate volume discount):
- Keep Salesforce, but renegotiate with volume commitment (140 seats)
- Negotiate 25% discount (from $150 → $112.50/seat)
- New Salesforce cost: 140 seats × $112.50/month = $189,000/year

**Savings**:
- Current: $240,000
- New: $189,000
- **Annual savings**: **$51,000** (21% reduction)

**Migration effort**:
- Data export/import: 40 hours
- User training: 20 hours
- **Total**: 60 hours × $75/hour = $4,500

**ROI**:
- Investment: $4,500
- Annual savings: $51,000
- **ROI**: 1,133%
- **Payback**: 1 month

**Verdict**: ✅ Yes, consolidate!

## Calculator 6: Multi-Currency Optimization Savings (SEA-Specific)

**Use this to calculate savings from switching USD pricing to local currency.**

### Currency Comparison

**For each tool** (check if vendor offers local currency pricing):

| Tool | Current (USD) | Local Currency Available? | Local Price | FX Rate | USD Equivalent | Savings |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Salesforce | $180,000/yr | ✅ SGD | SGD $165,000 | 1.35 | $122,222 | $57,778 |
| HubSpot | $60,000/yr | ✅ SGD | SGD $55,000 | 1.35 | $40,741 | $19,259 |
| Slack | $75,000/yr | ❌ No | N/A | N/A | N/A | $0 |
| _____ | $_____ | _____ | _____ | _____ | $_____ | $_____ |

**Total currency optimization savings**: **$_____ / year**

---

### SEA Currency Arbitrage Opportunities

**Major vendors with local currency pricing**:
- Salesforce: SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, PHP
- HubSpot: SGD, MYR
- Google Workspace: SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, VND, PHP
- Microsoft 365: SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, VND, PHP
- Zendesk: SGD, MYR
- Atlassian: SGD, MYR

**Typical savings**: 10-20% (local currency vs USD)

**Why vendors offer discounts in local currency**:
- Lower pricing power in emerging markets (ID, PH, VN)
- FX hedging (vendors lock in rates, pass savings to customers)
- Market penetration (lower prices to gain market share)

---

### Example: Singapore Company Switching to SGD Pricing

**Current (USD pricing)**:
- Salesforce: $180,000/year
- HubSpot: $60,000/year
- Google Workspace: $50,000/year
- **Total**: $290,000/year (in USD)

**New (SGD pricing)**:
- Salesforce: SGD $165,000 = $122,222 USD (at 1.35 FX)
- HubSpot: SGD $55,000 = $40,741 USD
- Google Workspace: SGD $46,000 = $34,074 USD
- **Total**: SGD $266,000 = **$197,037 USD**

**Savings**: $290,000 - $197,037 = **$92,963/year** (32% reduction!)

**Note**: FX rates fluctuate. Lock in local currency pricing when USD is strong (higher FX rate = better arbitrage).
