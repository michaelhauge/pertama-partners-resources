## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Trying to Do Everything at Once

**Problem**: Set up all workflows in Week 1
**Impact**: Overwhelmed, nothing works well, give up
**Solution**: Start with ONE workflow, master it, then expand

---

### Mistake 2: Not Measuring ROI

**Problem**: Set up tools, never track if they're actually saving time
**Impact**: Waste money on tools that don't help
**Solution**: Track time before/after for 2 weeks, calculate ROI

---

### Mistake 3: Choosing Based on Hype, Not Pain

**Problem**: "Everyone uses ChatGPT so I should too"
**Impact**: Tool doesn't solve your actual problem
**Solution**: Use assessment to find highest pain, choose workflow for that

---

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Team Adoption

**Problem**: Set up perfect system, team doesn't use it
**Impact**: Wasted effort
**Solution**: Start solo, prove ROI, then train team
