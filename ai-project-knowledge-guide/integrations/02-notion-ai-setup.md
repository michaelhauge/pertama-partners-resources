## Step 4: AI Workflows for PM

### Workflow 1: Meeting Notes → Action Items

**Problem**: After meetings, manually creating tasks is tedious

**AI Solution**:

1. **Paste meeting transcript** into a Notion page (from Otter.ai, manual notes, or Zoom transcript)

2. **Highlight transcript** (or select all)

3. **Ask Notion AI**: "Extract action items from this meeting"

4. **Notion AI generates**:
   ```
   Action Items:
   - John to draft pricing proposal by Friday
   - Sarah to review API documentation by Thursday
   - Mike to follow up with vendor about rate limits
   ```

5. **Create tasks**: Copy each action item, create task in Tasks database

**Time saved**: 10 min manual task creation → 2 min with AI extraction

---

**Advanced: Auto-link to Tasks database**

1. After AI extracts action items
2. Select each action item
3. Type `@Tasks` to create linked task
4. Notion creates task in Tasks database and links it to meeting notes

---

### Workflow 2: Voice Note → Structured Note

**Problem**: You have ideas while walking/driving, but voice notes are messy

**AI Solution**:

1. **Record voice note** on phone (Voice Memos app or Otter.ai)

2. **Transcribe** (Otter.ai or Whisper API)

3. **Paste transcript into Notion**

4. **Ask Notion AI**: "Extract key points, suggest tags, format as structured note"

5. **Notion AI generates**:
   ```
   # Pricing Strategy Idea

   ## Core Concept
   Three-tier pricing model

   ## Tiers
   1. **Basic**: Free, limited features
   2. **Pro**: $20/month
   3. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

   ## Next Steps
   - Define features per tier
   - Test with 10-15 customers
   - Follow up with Sarah on previous discussion

   ## Tags
   #pricing #strategy #product
   ```

**Time saved**: 5 min manual note-taking → 30 seconds AI processing

---

### Workflow 3: Long Document → Summary

**Problem**: You saved a 3,000-word article but will never read it

**AI Solution**:

1. **Paste article** into Notion page

2. **Select all** (Cmd+A or Ctrl+A)

3. **Ask Notion AI**: "Summarize this article, extract key takeaways"

4. **Notion AI generates** (at top of page or new page):
   ```
   # Article Summary: AI Productivity Best Practices

   **Source**: https://example.com/ai-productivity
   **Date Saved**: 2026-02-07

   ## Key Takeaways
   1. Start with one AI workflow, master it before adding more
   2. Measure ROI (time saved × hourly rate vs cost)
   3. Most ROI from automating repetitive tasks, not creative work

   ## Relevant Quotes
   > "The biggest mistake is trying to use AI for everything. Focus on your top 3 time sinks first."

   ## How This Applies to Us
   - Focus on meeting notes automation first (our #1 time sink)
   - Track ROI weekly to justify continued investment
   ```

**Time saved**: 15 min reading → 2 min AI summary

---

### Workflow 4: Q&A Over Knowledge Base

**Problem**: "Where did we document the pricing decision?"

**AI Solution**:

1. **Type question** in any Notion page (or use Search)

2. **Ask Notion AI**: "What did we decide about pricing last month?"

3. **Notion AI searches** entire workspace, returns answer:
   ```
   Based on [[Q1 Planning Meeting]], the pricing decision was:

   - Three-tier model: Free, Pro ($20/month), Enterprise (custom)
   - Launch target: Feb 15, 2026
   - Sarah is leading pricing page implementation

   Source: [[Meeting Notes - Product Sync - Jan 28]]
   ```

**Time saved**: 5 min searching manually → 10 seconds with AI Q&A

---

### Workflow 5: Generate Documents from Prompts

**Problem**: Writing proposals, SOPs, or docs from scratch is slow

**AI Solution**:

1. **Create new page**

2. **Type prompt**: "Write a proposal for [client] based on our standard terms and pricing"

3. **Press Space** → Notion AI generates draft

4. **Notion AI pulls from**:
   - [[Standard Proposal Template]]
   - [[Pricing Structure]]
   - [[Service Descriptions]]
   - [[Case Studies]]

5. **Output**: Custom proposal with YOUR company context

**Time saved**: 1 hour writing from scratch → 10 min with AI + editing

---

## Step 5: Organization & Tagging with AI

### Auto-Tagging

**Problem**: Manually tagging notes is tedious, and you forget tags

**AI Solution**:

1. **Write or paste content** into page

2. **Select text**

3. **Ask Notion AI**: "Suggest tags for this note"

4. **Notion AI suggests**: `#meeting-notes #product #pricing #decision`

5. **You add tags** to page properties (or use Notion AI to add them)

**Consistency**: AI uses existing tags in your workspace (not random new ones)

---

### Weekly AI Linking

**Problem**: Notes are isolated - no connections between related content

**AI Solution** (manual, weekly ritual):

1. **Select 10-20 recent notes**

2. **Ask Notion AI** (for each): "Find related notes in my knowledge base and suggest links"

3. **AI suggests**: "This note relates to [[Pricing Strategy v2]] and [[Sarah Meeting - Q1 Planning]]"

4. **You add links** → Creates network of connected ideas

**Why this matters**: Your knowledge base becomes a graph, not just a list. AI surfaces connections you'd miss.

---

## Step 6: Templates for Consistency

### Create Templates with AI

**Example: Meeting Notes Template**

1. **Create new page** in Meeting Notes database

2. **Ask Notion AI**: "Create a meeting notes template with sections for Attendees, Agenda, Discussion, Decisions, and Action Items"

3. **Notion AI generates**:
   ```
   # Meeting Notes - [Title]

   **Date**: [Date]
   **Attendees**: [List]

   ## Agenda
   1. [Topic 1]
   2. [Topic 2]

   ## Discussion
   [Notes from discussion]

   ## Decisions Made
   - [Decision 1]
   - [Decision 2]

   ## Action Items
   - [ ] [Task] - [Owner] - [Due Date]
   - [ ] [Task] - [Owner] - [Due Date]

   ## Next Meeting
   [Date and agenda items for next time]
   ```

4. **Save as template**: Click "..." → "Turn into template"

5. **Use template**: When creating new meeting notes, select this template

---

### Other Useful Templates

**Weekly Review Template**:
- What I completed this week
- What's in progress
- Blockers
- Next week priorities

**Project Brief Template**:
- Project goal
- Success criteria
- Timeline
- Team and roles
- Risks and dependencies

**1-on-1 Template**:
- Topics to discuss
- Updates from last time
- Action items
- Notes

**AI can generate all of these** - just ask!

---

## Step 7: Automation with Notion AI

### Auto-Properties with AI

**Example**: Auto-set priority based on task description

1. **Create task**: "Fix critical payment bug affecting 20% of users"

2. **Notion AI detects** keywords ("critical", "bug", "affecting users")

3. **AI suggests**: Priority: 🔥 High

4. **You confirm** or manually adjust

**How to enable**:
- This is done via Notion AI prompts on individual pages
- For full automation, use n8n + Notion API (see advanced section)

---

## Integration with Other Tools

### Notion + Linear (via n8n)

**Workflow**:
1. Create task in Notion
2. n8n watches for new Notion tasks
3. Auto-creates equivalent issue in Linear
4. Syncs status changes bidirectionally

**Use case**: Team uses Notion for PM, but engineering team prefers Linear

---

### Notion + Claude MCP

**Workflow**:
1. Chat with Claude: "Create a task in Notion for X"
2. Claude uses Notion MCP to create task
3. You review in Notion

**See**: [Claude MCP Guide](01-claude-mcp-pm.md)

---

### Notion + Meeting Transcription

**Workflow**:
1. Otter.ai records meeting → Generates transcript
2. n8n fetches transcript
3. Sends to Claude API for AI extraction
4. Creates Notion page with meeting notes + action items
5. Auto-links tasks to Meeting Notes database

**See**: [Meeting-to-Task Pipeline](../guides/03-meeting-to-task-pipeline.md)

---

## Advanced: Notion API + n8n Automation

### Auto-Create Meeting Notes from Calendar

**Workflow**:

```
Google Calendar: Meeting scheduled
    ↓
n8n Trigger: 30 min before meeting
    ↓
n8n: Create Notion page in Meeting Notes database
  - Title: Meeting title + date
  - Attendees: From calendar invite
  - Agenda: Pulled from calendar description
    ↓
Slack notification: "Meeting notes page ready: [link]"
```

**Setup**: Requires n8n + Google Calendar API + Notion API

---

### Auto-Archive Completed Tasks

**Workflow**:

```
Notion Tasks database: Task marked as "Done"
    ↓
n8n Trigger: Status changed to "Done"
    ↓
n8n: Wait 7 days
    ↓
n8n: Move task to "Archived Tasks" database
```

**Benefit**: Keeps Tasks database clean without manual archiving

---

## Measuring Success

### Week 1-2: Baseline (Before Notion AI)

**Track manually**:
- Time creating tasks from meetings: _____ hours/week
- Time searching for information: _____ hours/week
- Time writing docs/proposals: _____ hours/week

**Typical baseline**:
- 3-5 hours/week on task creation
- 5-10 hours/week searching for information
- 2-4 hours/week writing docs

---

### Week 3-4: With Notion AI

**Track same metrics**:
- Task creation: _____ hours (target: <1 hour)
- Information search: _____ hours (target: <2 hours)
- Doc writing: _____ hours (target: <1 hour)

**Expected improvement**:
- 70% reduction in task creation time
- 60% reduction in search time
- 50% reduction in doc writing time

---

### ROI Calculation

**Solo user**:
- Time saved: 10 hours/week
- Value: 10h × $100/hour = $1,000/week
- Cost: $20/month (Notion Plus + AI)
- **ROI**: 50x return

**Team of 10**:
- Time saved: 5 hours/week/person (average)
- Value: 5h × 10 × $75/hour × 4 weeks = $15,000/month
- Cost: $200/month (10 users × $20)
- **ROI**: 75x return

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notion AI Not Showing Up

**Cause**: Notion AI not enabled or subscription lapsed

**Fix**:
1. Go to Settings → Plans
2. Verify "Notion AI" is active
3. If not, click "Add Notion AI" and complete payment

---

### Issue: AI Gives Generic Responses (Not Using My Data)

**Cause**: AI doesn't have context from your workspace

**Fix**: Be more specific in prompts
- ❌ Bad: "What did we decide about pricing?"
- ✅ Good: "Search my Notion workspace for pricing decisions from Q1 meetings"

---

### Issue: AI Q&A Returns Outdated Info

**Cause**: AI indexed old version of page

**Fix**:
1. Update the page
2. Wait 5 min for re-indexing
3. Try query again

---

### Issue: Slow Performance with Large Databases

**Cause**: Notion can be slow with >10,000 items in a database

**Fix**:
1. Archive old tasks (move to "Archived Tasks" database)
2. Split large databases into multiple smaller ones
3. Use filters to reduce visible rows

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using Notion AI Like Google

**Problem**: "Notion AI, what's the capital of France?" (generic queries)

**Impact**: Wasting AI on info available on web

**Solution**: Use Notion AI for your company-specific knowledge, not general facts

---

### Mistake 2: Not Organizing Before AI-ing

**Problem**: Dump 100 unorganized notes, then ask AI to organize

**Impact**: AI can't help with chaos

**Solution**: Start with minimal structure (databases), then let AI help maintain it

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring AI Suggestions

**Problem**: AI suggests tags, you ignore and manually tag differently

**Impact**: Inconsistent tagging, hard to search

**Solution**: Trust AI's tag suggestions (it sees patterns across workspace)

---
