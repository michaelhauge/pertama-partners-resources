## General Remote Work

### "Is remote work right for my business?"

**Remote work works well for**:
- Knowledge work (writing, design, coding, analysis, strategy)
- Asynchronous tasks (work that doesn't require immediate collaboration)
- Companies willing to invest in tools and processes
- Teams with clear goals and accountability

**Remote work is HARD for**:
- Physical/on-site work (retail, manufacturing, healthcare delivery)
- Highly synchronous work (trading desks, emergency response)
- Companies unwilling to change processes from office model
- Roles requiring expensive specialized equipment

**Test**: Can your employees do their job with just a laptop and internet? If yes, remote is viable.

---

### "Should we go fully remote, hybrid, or stay in-office?"

**Decision matrix**:

| Factor | Fully Remote | Hybrid | Office |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| **Talent pool** | Global (best) | Local + some remote | Local only (worst) |
| **Cost** | Lowest (no office) | Medium | Highest (full office) |
| **Productivity** | High (if done right) | Variable | Medium |
| **Culture building** | Intentional required | Easier | Easiest |
| **Flexibility** | Highest | Medium | Lowest |
| **Coordination** | Async-first required | Can be sync | Naturally sync |

**Recommendation**:
- **Fully remote** if: Cost-conscious, hiring across geographies, knowledge work
- **Hybrid** if: Need office for specific tasks, local team, transitioning
- **Office** if: Physical work, highly synchronous, or strong preference

**Note**: Hybrid is HARDEST to do well (risk of remote second-class citizens). Requires strong remote-first practices.

---

### "How do we transition from office to remote?"

**Don't go cold turkey. Phase it**:

**Phase 1 (Month 1): Test remote**
- 1-2 days/week remote for all employees
- Use this time to test tools, identify gaps
- Survey: What worked, what didn't?

**Phase 2 (Month 2): Increase remote days**
- 3 days/week remote, 2 days office
- Implement async communication practices
- Document processes

**Phase 3 (Month 3): Full remote or hybrid**
- Go full remote OR establish hybrid schedule
- Reduce office space (save costs)
- Formalize remote work policy

**Key**: Get tools right BEFORE going remote (see [Guide 02](guides/02-communication-setup.md))

---

## Tools & Technology

### "What tools do we NEED to go remote?"

**Minimum viable stack** ($20-40/user/month):
1. **Communication**: Slack OR Teams
2. **Video**: Zoom OR Meet/Teams (use what's included)
3. **Project Management**: Asana OR Monday OR ClickUp OR Linear
4. **Documentation**: Notion OR Confluence
5. **File Storage**: Google Drive OR OneDrive (included with Workspace/M365)

**Nice to have** (add after core is working):
- AI productivity (Claude, Otter.ai)
- Performance management (15Five, Lattice)
- Recognition (Bonusly, Donut)

**See**: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) for full comparison

---

### "Should we use Slack or Microsoft Teams?"

**Quick answer**:
- Use **Teams** if you're using Microsoft 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint)
- Use **Slack** if you're using Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs)

**Why**: Avoid paying for two overlapping tools. Stick with ecosystem you're already in.

**Exception**: Tech startups often prefer Slack regardless (better integrations, preferred by tech workers in SEA).

**See**: [Guide 02: Communication Setup](guides/02-communication-setup.md) for detailed comparison

---

### "Do we need time tracking software?"

**For most knowledge workers: NO.**

**Use time tracking ONLY if**:
- Billing clients hourly (consulting, agencies)
- Legal/compliance requirement
- Managing hourly contractors

**Do NOT use time tracking for**:
- Salaried employees
- Knowledge workers
- "Productivity monitoring" (destroys trust)

**Better alternatives**:
- Output-based metrics (features shipped, deals closed)
- Regular 1:1s with clear expectations
- Weekly async updates

**See**: [Guide 07: Time Tracking](guides/07-time-tracking.md) for when it makes sense

---

### "Should we use employee monitoring software (screenshots, mouse tracking)?"

**Short answer: NO. NEVER.**

**Why monitoring is bad**:
- Destroys trust and culture
- Measures activity, not productivity
- Employees will game the system (move mouse with weight)
- Creates toxic environment
- High performers leave

**What to do instead**:
- Hire people you trust
- Set clear expectations and goals (OKRs)
- Measure outputs, not inputs
- Regular 1:1s to discuss progress
- If someone isn't performing, it will be obvious (bad output)

**If you don't trust employees to work remote, you have hiring problem, not monitoring problem.**

---

### "What AI tools should remote teams use?"

**Core recommendations** (in priority order):

**1. Meeting transcription** ($10/user/month)
- **Otter.ai** or **Fireflies.ai**
- Auto-join meetings, transcribe, create AI summaries
- Huge time saver for meetings
- **ROI**: 2-3 hours/week saved per person

**2. Documentation assistant** ($20/user/month)
- **Claude** or **ChatGPT Plus/Team**
- Write docs, summarize content, research
- Draft emails, create reports
- **ROI**: 5-10 hours/week saved per person

**3. Knowledge base AI** ($10/user/month, if using Notion)
- **Notion AI**
- Auto-summaries, Q&A on docs
- **ROI**: Faster onboarding, better search

**Total investment**: $40/user/month for all three
**Total savings**: 10-20 hours/week per person
**ROI**: 10x+

**See**: [Guide 03: AI Productivity](guides/03-ai-productivity.md) for implementation

---

## Performance & Productivity

### "How do I know remote employees are actually working?"

**This question reveals office-mindset thinking**:
- Office mindset: "If I see them at desk, they're working"
- Reality: Presence ≠ productivity (plenty of people "look busy" while accomplishing nothing)

**Remote mindset**:
- **Focus on output, not input**
- Did they ship what they committed to?
- Are they meeting their goals?
- Is work quality good?

**How to measure remote productivity**:

**1. Set clear expectations** (OKRs, goals)
- Every employee knows: "What does success look like?"
- Weekly/bi-weekly check-ins on progress

**2. Weekly async updates** (15 min to write)
- What I shipped this week
- What I'm working on next week
- What I'm blocked on
- Posted in Slack or project management tool

**3. Regular 1:1s** (30 min weekly)
- Discuss progress, challenges, growth
- If employee is stuck, becomes obvious
- If employee is excelling, also obvious

**4. Measure outputs, not hours**
- Engineering: Features shipped, bugs fixed, code reviews
- Sales: Deals closed, pipeline generated
- Marketing: Campaigns launched, content published, leads generated
- Support: Tickets resolved, customer satisfaction

**If someone isn't performing, it will be OBVIOUS** - they won't hit their goals, work quality will suffer. Don't need surveillance to see this.

**See**: [Guide 05: Performance Management](guides/05-performance-management.md)

---

### "Aren't remote employees less productive than office?"

**Data says otherwise**:
- Stanford study: Remote employees are 13% more productive than office
- Gallup: Remote employees work 4+ hours more per week (no commute)
- Remote employees report 22% higher job satisfaction
- Remote employees have 50% lower turnover

**Why remote can be MORE productive**:
- Fewer interruptions (no shoulder taps)
- Deep work possible (focus time)
- Flexible schedule (work when you're most productive)
- No commute time (2-4 hours/week saved)

**Why remote can be LESS productive** (if done wrong):
- No clear expectations or accountability
- Tool chaos (too many platforms)
- Meeting overload (back-to-back Zooms)
- Lack of async processes (forced to wait for responses)

**The difference**: Implementation. Remote done right is highly productive.

---

### "How do we handle underperformance remotely?"

**Same way as in office** (clear communication, support, action):

**Step 1: Clarify expectations** (Week 1)
- Have 1:1 conversation: "Here's what I expect, here's what I'm seeing"
- Set specific, measurable goals
- Document the conversation

**Step 2: Support and check-ins** (Week 2-4)
- Weekly 1:1s to discuss progress
- Provide resources, remove blockers
- Coach and mentor

**Step 3: Performance improvement plan** (if no improvement)
- Formal PIP with written goals
- 30-60 day timeline
- Clear consequences if not met

**Step 4: Part ways** (if still no improvement)
- Follow local employment laws
- Notice period and severance per country requirements

**Key difference remote**: Documentation is even MORE important (paper trail matters for legal).

**See**: [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md) for country-specific termination rules

---

## Cross-Border & Compliance

### "Can we hire employees in other SEA countries without setting up companies there?"

**Yes, via EOR (Employer of Record) providers.**

**How EOR works**:
- You find candidate in Malaysia, Indonesia, etc.
- EOR provider becomes legal employer in that country
- You manage employee day-to-day (they work for you)
- EOR handles: Payroll, taxes, compliance, benefits, contracts
- Cost: $300-600/employee/month

**When to use EOR**:
- Hiring 1-10 employees in a country
- Testing new market
- Want to move fast (1-2 weeks vs months for entity setup)

**EOR providers**: Deel, Remote.com, Oyster (see [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md) comparison)

**See**: [Guide 08: SEA Employment](guides/08-sea-employment.md) for full guide

---

### "What's the difference between contractor and employee?"

**Critical distinction** (misclassification = penalties):

**Employee** (must provide benefits, taxes, labor protections):
- Works exclusively or primarily for you
- Follows your schedule and processes
- Uses your equipment
- Receives monthly salary
- You control HOW work is done

**Contractor** (no benefits required):
- Works for multiple clients
- Sets own schedule and methods
- Uses own equipment
- Invoices per project
- Controls HOW work is done
- Bears own business risk

**Test**: If 3+ employee indicators apply, likely an EMPLOYEE (not contractor).

**Risks of misclassification**:
- Back-payment of benefits, taxes
- Penalties and fines
- Criminal liability (in some countries like Philippines)

**See**: [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md) for country-specific tests

---

### "What are the employment law differences across SEA countries?"

**Key differences to know**:

| Country | Minimum Wage | Mandatory Bonus | Severance | Social Insurance |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Singapore** | No minimum (locals) | No | No (unless specified) | CPF: 37% of salary |
| **Malaysia** | RM 1,500/mo | No | 10-20 days/year | EPF: 24% + SOCSO |
| **Indonesia** | Varies (IDR 3-5M/mo) | **THR: 1 month** (mandatory!) | Very high (up to 9+ months) | BPJS: ~11% |
| **Thailand** | 330-354 baht/day | No | 30-300 days (based on tenure) | SSF: 10% |
| **Vietnam** | VND 3.4-5M/mo | No | 0.5 months/year | SI: 32% |
| **Philippines** | ₱340-610/day | **13th month** (mandatory!) | 1 month OR 0.5/year | SSS/PhilHealth/Pag-IBIG: 18% |

**Key takeaways**:
- Indonesia and Philippines have MANDATORY year-end bonuses (budget for 13-14 months salary)
- Indonesia has VERY high severance costs (use EOR to mitigate risk)
- All countries have mandatory social insurance (adds 10-37% to salary cost)

**See**: [COMPLIANCE.md](COMPLIANCE.md) for full country-by-country breakdown

---

### "When should we set up a local entity vs using EOR?"

**Use EOR if**:
- 1-10 employees in a country
- Testing market
- Want speed and simplicity

**Set up local entity if**:
- 10+ employees in one country (lower per-employee cost)
- Long-term commitment (5+ years)
- Need physical presence (bank account, office)
- Industry requires local entity

**Break-even**: Usually 10-15 employees in one country

**Costs**:
- **EOR**: $599/employee/month = $71,880/year for 10 employees
- **Entity**: $5K-20K setup + $2K-10K annual + $200-400/employee payroll = ~$35K/year for 10 employees

**See**: [Guide 08: SEA Employment](guides/08-sea-employment.md) for decision framework

---

## Culture & Communication

### "How do we build company culture remotely?"

**Remote culture is INTENTIONAL, not accidental.**

**Key strategies**:

**1. Async-first communication** (see [CULTURE.md](CULTURE.md))
- Documentation over meetings
- Written updates over "quick syncs"
- RFC process for decisions

**2. Regular connection rituals**
- Weekly wins channel
- Virtual coffee (Donut - $3/user/mo)
- Monthly team activities (games, watch party)

**3. Recognition programs**
- Bonusly or HeyTaco ($3/user/mo)
- Public kudos channel
- Celebrate wins

**4. Remote retreats**
- Quarterly or bi-annual in-person gatherings
- SEA destinations: Bali, Chiang Mai, Penang, Bintan
- 2-3 days, mix work and fun

**5. Strong onboarding**
- Buddy system
- 30-60-90 day plan
- Over-communicate

**See**: [Guide 10: Team Cohesion](guides/10-team-cohesion.md) for full strategies

---

### "How many meetings should remote teams have?"

**General guideline**: Meetings should be <50% of working time.

**Healthy remote team**:
- 15-20 hours/week in meetings (for 40-hour week)
- 20-25 hours for deep work and async communication

**Too many meetings** (>25 hours/week):
- Employees complain about no focus time
- Back-to-back all day
- Low engagement (cameras off, multitasking)

**Strategies to reduce meetings**:
- **Async standup** (write updates in Slack)
- **No-meeting days** (Wednesday = Focus Day)
- **RFC process** for decisions (instead of decision meetings)
- **5-minute rule** (if it can be written in 5 min, don't meet)

**See**: [CULTURE.md](CULTURE.md) for async-first patterns

---

### "How do we handle different timezones in SEA?"

**SEA timezone reality**:
- Singapore/Malaysia/Philippines: GMT+8 (same time!)
- Indonesia: GMT+7 (WIB), GMT+8 (WITA), GMT+9 (WIT) - 3 timezones!
- Thailand/Vietnam: GMT+7
- Max difference: 2 hours (manageable)

**Strategies**:

**1. Find overlap hours** (everyone available)
- Usually: 9 AM - 12 PM SGT (Singapore time)
- That's 3 hours of overlap
- Use [timezone-overlap.py](scripts/timezone-overlap.py) script

**2. Use overlap wisely**
- Reserve for: Sync meetings that require everyone
- Don't waste on: Status updates (can be async)

**3. Async by default**
- 80% of communication should be async
- Meetings are exception

**4. Rotate meeting times** (if wider timezone spread)
- Don't always favor one timezone
- Alternate who gets inconvenient times

**5. Record everything**
- Record meetings for those who can't attend
- Post notes and decisions

**See**: [Guide 07: Time Tracking](guides/07-time-tracking.md) for timezone management

---

### "How do we onboard remote employees effectively?"

**Remote onboarding is 80% documentation, 20% meetings.**

**Key elements**:

**Pre-Day 1**:
- Ship equipment early (1 week before)
- Create all accounts
- Send welcome packet with Day 1 agenda
- Assign buddy

**Day 1**:
- Welcome call with manager (30 min)
- Team intro call (30 min - everyone says hi)
- Buddy call (30 min)
- Share all onboarding docs
- Give first small task (achievable same day - quick win)

**Week 1**:
- Daily check-ins (manager and buddy)
- Meet key stakeholders
- Read onboarding docs
- Complete first small project

**30-60-90 day plan** with clear milestones

**Template**: [templates/onboarding-remote.md](templates/onboarding-remote.md)

**See**: [CULTURE.md](CULTURE.md) Part 6 for full onboarding guide

---

## Security

### "Is remote work less secure than office?"

**Can be MORE secure or LESS secure** - depends on implementation.

**Office security risks**:
- Shoulder surfing (people see screens)
- Unlocked computers (people walk away)
- Paper documents left on desks
- Visitors in office

**Remote security risks**:
- Home Wi-Fi (often unsecured)
- Personal devices (no company security)
- Public Wi-Fi (coffee shops)
- Family members accessing devices

**Solution**: Implement remote security measures:
- VPN required (all remote access)
- Device management (MDM for remote wipe)
- Full disk encryption (FileVault, BitLocker)
- MFA on all accounts
- Home office security training

**See**: [Guide 09: Remote Security](guides/09-security-remote.md) and [SMB Cybersecurity Guide](../smb-cybersecurity-guide/)

---

### "Do remote employees need VPN?"

**Yes, when accessing company systems from**:
- Public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- Untrusted networks
- When accessing sensitive data

**VPN recommendations**:
- **Cloudflare Zero Trust**: Free (up to 50 users)
- **NordLayer**: $8/user/month
- **Tailscale**: Free (up to 100 devices)
- **Perimeter 81**: $8/user/month

**See**: [Guide 09: Remote Security](guides/09-security-remote.md) and [SMB Cybersecurity Guide: Network Security](../smb-cybersecurity-guide/guides/05-network-security.md)

---

## Cost & ROI

**ROI**:
- Office cost savings: $500-2,000/user/month (if going fully remote)
- AI productivity: 10-20 hours/week saved team-wide
- Cross-border hiring: $2K-5K/month salary differential
- **Payback period**: 1-3 months

**See**: README.md for detailed cost breakdown by company size

---

### "Can we really save money by going remote?"

**Yes, significant savings** (if done right):

**10-person company going fully remote**:
- Office space: Save $24K-48K/year
- Tool consolidation: Save $1.2K-3.6K/year
- AI productivity: Save $30K-45K/year (time value)
- Cross-border hiring: Save $50K-100K/year
- **Total savings**: $105K-197K/year

**50-person company going hybrid** (50% remote):
- Office space: Save $60K-120K/year (reduce by 50%)
- Tool consolidation: Save $6K-18K/year
- AI productivity: Save $90K-135K/year
- Cross-border hiring: Save $250K-500K/year
- **Total savings**: $400K-770K/year

**But requires investment**: $15-50/user/month in tools

**Net savings**: Still massive (6-10x return)

---

### "Can we do this ourselves or should we hire consultants?"

**You can do this yourself** (that's why this guide exists).

**When to hire external help**:
- Cross-border hiring (EOR provider - Deel, Remote, Oyster)
- Local entity setup (legal counsel in target country)
- Tool migration (if complex/large-scale)
- Training (if team needs workshops)

**When NOT to hire external help**:
- Basic tool setup (Slack, Notion, etc. - easy DIY)
- Writing policies (use templates provided)
- Regular operations (managers should handle)

**Cost to hire external**:
- Remote work consultant: $150-300/hour (5-10 hours = $750-3K for setup)
- EOR: $599/employee/month (worth it for cross-border)
- Employment lawyer: $200-400/hour (worth it for compliance questions)

**Recommendation**: DIY with this guide, hire EOR for cross-border, consult lawyer for specific legal questions.
