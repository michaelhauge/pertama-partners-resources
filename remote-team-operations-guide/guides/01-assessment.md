## Common Questions

**"Our score is low - should we give up on remote work?"**

No! Scores below 40 are common for traditional businesses. This assessment helps you improve systematically. Start with Quick Wins and build from there.

**"We scored 75 but Section X is really weak (15 points or less) - is that a problem?"**

Yes, a single weak section can undermine the whole system. For example:
- Weak communication (Section 1) → Information gets lost
- Weak documentation (Section 2) → Knowledge leaves when people leave
- Weak performance (Section 4) → Managers panic and micromanage

Focus on bringing your weakest section up to at least 60% (3/5 points per question).

**"Can we skip sections that don't apply to us?"**

If you're not doing cross-border hiring, Section 6 compliance may not fully apply. Adjust your denominator:
- Skip 5 points from Section 6.2
- New max: 95 points
- Recalculate: (Your score / 95) × 100 = Adjusted percentage

**"How often do scores improve?"**

Typical progress with focused effort:
- **Month 1**: +10-15 points (low-hanging fruit)
- **Quarter 1**: +20-30 points (systematic improvements)
- **Year 1**: +30-50 points (culture change takes hold)

Companies starting at 30-40 often reach 70-80 within 6-12 months.

## Next Steps

After completing this assessment:

1. **Identify your score bracket** (0-40, 41-70, 71-85, 86-100)
2. **Read the recommendations** for your bracket above
3. **Pick 1-3 priority actions** - don't try to fix everything at once
4. **Set a timeline** - most improvements take 2-12 weeks
5. **Follow the recommended guides** - they're designed to help you improve each section

**Start with the guide for your lowest-scoring section** - that's your highest-leverage improvement opportunity.
