## Why Cross-Border Hiring in SEA?

### The Opportunity

**Traditional model**: Hire only in your country (e.g., Singapore).

**Problem**:
- ❌ Singapore talent is expensive ($80k-$150k USD for mid-level roles)
- ❌ Limited talent pool (5.6M people)
- ❌ High cost of living → High salary expectations

**Cross-border model**: Hire across Southeast Asia.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Lower costs**: 40-60% salary savings (Philippines, Vietnam vs Singapore)
- ✅ **Larger talent pool**: 680M people across SEA (vs 5.6M in Singapore)
- ✅ **High quality**: Excellent talent in Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur
- ✅ **Similar timezones**: GMT+7 to GMT+8 (1 hour difference max)
- ✅ **English proficiency**: Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia (high), Thailand, Vietnam (growing)

**ROI Example**:
- Singapore Software Engineer: $100k USD/year
- Manila Software Engineer (same quality): $40k USD/year
- **Savings**: $60k/year per hire
- 5 hires: **$300k/year saved**

## The Decision: EOR vs Local Entity

### What is an EOR?

**EOR (Employer of Record)** = Company that legally employs your team member on your behalf.

**How it works**:
1. You find and interview candidate in another country (e.g., Philippines)
2. You use EOR (Deel, Remote, Oyster) to hire them
3. EOR handles: Employment contract, payroll, taxes, benefits, compliance
4. You manage the employee day-to-day (as if they're your direct employee)
5. You pay EOR: Employee salary + $599/month fee

**EOR vs Local Entity**:

| Factor | EOR | Local Entity |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| **Setup time** | 1-2 weeks | 3-6 months |
| **Setup cost** | $0 upfront | $5,000-$20,000 (legal, registration) |
| **Monthly cost per employee** | $599 (Deel, Remote, Oyster) | $0 fee, but overhead (HR, accounting) |
| **Compliance risk** | Low (EOR handles) | High (you're responsible) |
| **Flexibility** | High (hire 1 person, scale up/down easily) | Low (committed to entity) |
| **Break-even point** | N/A | 10-15 employees in same country |
| **Best for** | 1-10 employees per country | 15+ employees in same country |

### When to Use EOR

✅ **Use EOR if**:
- Hiring 1-10 people in a country
- Testing new market (not sure if you'll scale there)
- Want speed (hire in 1-2 weeks)
- Don't want compliance headaches
- Value flexibility (easy to scale up/down)

### When to Use Local Entity

✅ **Use Local Entity if**:
- Hiring 15+ people in same country (EOR fees add up)
- Long-term commitment to that market (5+ years)
- Want full control (no intermediary)
- Have local HR/legal expertise

**Most SEA SMBs should start with EOR**. Switch to local entity when you hit 10-15 employees in one country.

## Top EOR Providers (2026 Comparison)

### The Big Three

| Provider | Cost per Employee | Setup Time | Countries Covered | Best For |
|----------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Deel** | $599/month | 1-2 weeks | 150+ countries (SEA: All) | Best overall (SEA coverage, ease of use) |
| **Remote.com** | $599/month | 1-2 weeks | 70+ countries (SEA: SG, MY, PH, ID, TH, VN) | Similar to Deel, solid alternative |
| **Oyster** | $599/month | 1-2 weeks | 180+ countries (SEA: All) | Focus on distributed teams, good UX |

**All three are excellent**. Choose based on:
- Which countries you need (all three cover major SEA countries)
- User interface preference (try demos)
- Existing tools (integrations with your HRIS, payroll)

**Our recommendation**: **Deel** (most popular in SEA, excellent support, easiest to use).

### How to Determine Fair Salary

**Don't just guess**. Use these resources:

**Global salary databases**:
- Levels.fyi (tech roles)
- Glassdoor (all roles, by location)
- PayScale (all roles)

**SEA-specific**:
- JobStreet Salary Report (Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore)
- LinkedIn Salary Insights (select country)

**Adjust for**:
- Experience level (junior, mid, senior)
- City (Manila costs more than provincial Philippines)
- Specific skills (AI/ML engineers command premium)
- Company stage (startups pay less than multinationals)

### Cost Comparison Example

**Scenario**: Hire 5 software engineers (mid-level).

| Country | Average Salary | Employer Costs (Benefits) | EOR Fee | Total Cost per Person | Total (5 Engineers) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Singapore** | $100,000 | $17,000 (CPF) | $0 | $117,000 | **$585,000/year** |
| **Philippines** | $35,000 | $11,550 (13th month + SSS/PhilHealth/Pag-IBIG) | $7,188 | $53,738 | **$268,690/year** |

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "Employee is really a contractor" (Misclassification)

**Symptom**: Hiring someone in another country as "contractor" (easier, no EOR needed).

**Risk**: If government audits and determines they're really an employee, you face:
- ❌ Back taxes and penalties
- ❌ Severance owed
- ❌ Legal liability

**Employee vs Contractor test**:
- **Employee**: You control when/how they work, exclusive to your company, long-term, receives benefits
- **Contractor**: They control when/how they work, work for multiple clients, project-based

**Most remote workers are employees**, not contractors.

**Solution**: Use EOR for employees. Reserve "contractor" classification for true freelancers (project-based, non-exclusive).

### Pitfall 2: "We'll just pay them via PayPal/Wise" (No Employment Contract)

**Symptom**: Hiring someone, paying via PayPal/Wise, no formal contract.

**Risk**:
- ❌ No legal protection if dispute arises
- ❌ Employee can claim they're employee (not contractor) and sue for benefits
- ❌ No clarity on IP ownership, non-compete, etc.

**Solution**: Always use proper employment contract (via EOR) or contractor agreement (if truly a contractor).

### Pitfall 3: "EOR is too expensive" (False Economy)

**Symptom**: Avoiding EOR to save $599/month, trying to handle employment yourself.

**Reality**:
- Setting up local entity: $5k-$20k upfront + ongoing accounting/legal ($500-$1,000/month)
- Compliance risk: One mistake can cost $10k+ in penalties
- Time cost: Dozens of hours managing payroll, taxes, filings

**Solution**: Use EOR for first 1-10 hires per country. Only consider local entity at 10-15+ employees.

**Break-even**:
- EOR: $599/month × 10 employees = $5,990/month
- Local entity: ~$1,000/month overhead (after setup costs amortized)
- Break-even at ~15 employees (EOR $8,985/mo vs entity $1,000/mo)

### Pitfall 4: "We hired in Indonesia, now termination costs $50k"

**Symptom**: Didn't understand local severance laws. Hired in Indonesia, now termination is 2+ years salary.

**Prevention**:
- Read `COMPLIANCE.md` before hiring in any country
- Understand termination costs upfront
- Probation period: 3-6 months (easier to terminate during probation)
- Performance management: Document underperformance (in case termination is needed)

**Solution**: Use EOR. EOR calculates severance correctly and handles termination process.

### Pitfall 5: "Time zone is only 1 hour different, but communication is hard"

**Symptom**: Hired in Vietnam (GMT+7) vs Singapore (GMT+8). Only 1 hour difference, but communication is still hard.

**Cause**: Cultural differences, language barriers (not timezone).

**Solution**:
- Over-communicate in writing (don't assume context is understood)
- Use async communication (see `CULTURE.md`)
- Regular video check-ins (weekly 1:1s, see `guides/05-performance-management.md`)
- Patience: Cultural integration takes time (3-6 months)
