# Performance Management for Remote Teams

**Time to complete**: 1 quarter to establish rhythm
**Cost**: $0 (uses existing tools)
**Prerequisites**: Communication platform, documentation system
**Who owns this**: Managers and business owner

## Why Remote Performance Management is Different

**Office performance management**:
- See people working → Assume productivity
- Informal check-ins at desk
- Casual feedback in hallways
- "Presence = Performance" mentality

**Remote performance management requires**:
- ✅ **Output-based metrics** (not hours at desk)
- ✅ **Structured check-ins** (intentional, not accidental)
- ✅ **Written feedback** (async, documented)
- ✅ **Clear goals** (everyone knows what success looks like)

**The trap**: Managers panic when they can't "see" people working → Micromanagement, time tracking, surveillance.

**The solution**: Trust + verification through output, not input (hours worked).

---

## Phase 1: Goal Setting (OKRs or Simple Goals)

### Why Goals Matter

Without clear goals:
- ❌ Team doesn't know what to prioritize
- ❌ Managers can't measure performance
- ❌ "Am I doing well?" is ambiguous

With clear goals:
- ✅ Everyone knows what success looks like
- ✅ Performance is objective (did you hit your goals?)
- ✅ Self-directed work (team knows priorities)

**ROI**: Clear goals prevent wasted work. If 10% of work is misaligned, that's 4 hours/week per person wasted.
- 10 people × 4 hours/week = 40 hours/week = **$104k/year** wasted (at $50/hour)

### OKRs vs Simple Goals

| Approach | Best For | Complexity | Example |
|----------|----------|------------|---------|
| **OKRs** (Objectives & Key Results) | Tech/startups, ambitious goals | Medium | "Objective: Expand SEA presence<br>KR1: Launch in 3 new countries<br>KR2: Hire 5 local team members<br>KR3: Hit $500k ARR from SEA" |
| **Simple Goals** | Small companies, straightforward work | Low | "Q1 Goals:<br>- Ship new website<br>- Hire 2 engineers<br>- Hit $100k revenue" |

**Our recommendation for most SMBs**: Start with **Simple Goals**, upgrade to OKRs if needed.

**Why?** OKRs have learning curve. Simple goals are easier to adopt. You can always level up later.

### Simple Goals Framework

**Structure**: 3-5 goals per person per quarter.

**Good goal characteristics** (SMART):
- **Specific**: "Launch new website" not "Improve marketing"
- **Measurable**: "Hit $100k revenue" not "Grow sales"
- **Achievable**: Stretch but not impossible
- **Relevant**: Aligns with company priorities
- **Time-bound**: Quarterly (3 months)

**Template**:
```markdown
# [Name]'s Q1 2026 Goals

**Set on**: 2026-01-01
**Review on**: 2026-04-01
**Manager**: [Name]

## Goal 1: [Title]
**Description**: [What needs to be done?]
**Success metric**: [How do we know it's done?]
**Priority**: High / Medium / Low
**Status**: On Track / At Risk / Blocked

## Goal 2: [Title]
[Same structure]

## Goal 3: [Title]
[Same structure]
```

**Example (Engineering Manager)**:
```markdown
## Goal 1: Ship mobile app MVP
- Success metric: iOS app in TestFlight with 3 core features (login, profile, messaging)
- Priority: High
- Status: On Track

## Goal 2: Reduce bug backlog by 50%
- Success metric: Open bugs reduced from 80 to 40
- Priority: Medium
- Status: On Track

## Goal 3: Hire 2 senior engineers
- Success metric: 2 offers accepted, start dates confirmed
- Priority: High
- Status: At Risk (only 1 offer extended so far)
```

### How to Set Goals (Quarterly Cycle)

**Week before quarter starts**: Manager + Employee goal-setting 1:1 (30-60 min).

**Steps**:
1. **Review company priorities**: What are top 3 company goals this quarter?
2. **Brainstorm individual goals**: What can this person do to support company goals?
3. **Draft 3-5 goals** together (collaborative, not top-down)
4. **Define success metrics**: How will we know each goal is achieved?
5. **Set priorities**: High/Medium/Low
6. **Document** in Notion/Confluence or Google Doc
7. **Share with team** (optional but recommended for transparency)

**During quarter**:
- Weekly check-ins: Review goal progress (see Phase 2 below)
- Update status: On Track / At Risk / Blocked
- Adjust if needed (goals can evolve if priorities change)

**End of quarter**:
- Performance review: Did we hit goals? (see Phase 3 below)
- Score: % of goals achieved (e.g., 4 out of 5 = 80%)
- Set next quarter's goals

---

## Phase 2: Weekly Check-ins (1:1s)

### Why Weekly 1:1s?

**The problem with remote work**: Lack of informal face-time. In office, you naturally chat. Remote requires intention.

**Weekly 1:1s solve**:
- ✅ Regular feedback loop (catch issues early)
- ✅ Build relationship (manager knows how employee is doing)
- ✅ Unblock issues (remove obstacles quickly)
- ✅ Career development (not just task management)

**Frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly (30 minutes each).
- **Weekly** for new hires or when lots is changing
- **Bi-weekly** for experienced team members with clear goals

**Format**: Video call (camera on) + shared notes doc.

### 1:1 Structure (30 minutes)

**Agenda** (both manager and employee add topics):

```markdown
# [Name] ↔ [Manager] 1:1 - [Date]

## Employee Topics (10 min)
- [Employee adds topics before meeting]
- Example: "Feedback on my design doc?"
- Example: "I'm blocked on X, need help"
- Example: "Career growth question"

## Manager Topics (10 min)
- [Manager adds topics before meeting]
- Example: "Feedback on last week's presentation"
- Example: "Let's discuss Q1 goal progress"

## Goal Progress Check (5 min)
- Goal 1: [Status update]
- Goal 2: [Status update]
- Goal 3: [Status update]

## Action Items (5 min)
- [ ] [Person] will [task] by [date]
- [ ] [Person] will [task] by [date]

## Next 1:1: [Date]
```

**Template**: See `templates/1on1-template.md` for full template.

### Best Practices

**Before meeting**:
- ✅ Both people add agenda topics (24 hours before)
- ✅ Review last week's action items
- ✅ Check goal progress

**During meeting**:
- ✅ Start with employee topics (they drive the agenda)
- ✅ Take notes in shared doc (both can edit)
- ✅ Be present (camera on, minimize distractions)
- ✅ End with clear action items

**After meeting**:
- ✅ Review action items (both people)
- ✅ No action items? That's okay (sometimes it's just a check-in)

**What to avoid**:
- ❌ Skipping 1:1s ("too busy") - this signals low priority
- ❌ Using 1:1s only for status updates (that's what Slack is for)
- ❌ Manager dominates conversation (should be 50/50 or employee-led)
- ❌ No agenda (wastes time)

### Async Alternative: Written Check-ins

**If team is in very different timezones** or video fatigue is high:

**Weekly written update** (5-10 min to write):
```markdown
# Weekly Update - [Name] - Week of [Date]

**Last week**:
- Completed: [Accomplishments]
- Progress: [What moved forward]

**This week**:
- Plan: [Focus areas]
- Priorities: [Top 2-3 tasks]

**Blockers**: [Anything blocking progress]

**FYI**: [Anything manager should know]

**Questions**: [Anything you need help with]
```

**Manager responds** (written or video Loom):
- Acknowledge accomplishments
- Answer questions
- Provide feedback or guidance
- Clear blockers

**Combine with less frequent video 1:1s**: Bi-weekly or monthly video + weekly written updates.

---

## Phase 3: Performance Reviews (Quarterly or Annually)

### Why Structured Reviews?

Without reviews:
- ❌ Performance feedback is ad-hoc or missing
- ❌ No formal record of growth
- ❌ Surprises (employee doesn't know how they're doing)
- ❌ Compensation decisions feel arbitrary

With structured reviews:
- ✅ Clear feedback (employee knows where they stand)
- ✅ Growth plan (next level, skill gaps)
- ✅ Documentation (record for promotions, compensation)
- ✅ No surprises (regular check-ins build to this)

**Frequency**:
- **Quarterly** (recommended for small companies): Aligns with goal-setting cycle
- **Annual** (traditional): Once per year, often tied to compensation

**Duration**: 60-90 minutes per review (30 min prep + 60 min meeting).

### Review Structure

**Before the review** (1 week ahead):

1. **Employee self-assessment** (30 min):
   - Review goals: Which did you achieve?
   - Self-rate: How do you think you performed?
   - Strengths: What went well?
   - Growth areas: What could improve?
   - Next quarter/year: What do you want to work on?

2. **Manager assessment** (30 min):
   - Review goals: What did employee achieve?
   - Rate performance (see rubric below)
   - Gather peer feedback (optional, for larger teams)
   - Prepare examples (specific, not generic)

**During the review** (60 min):

1. **Employee shares self-assessment** (10 min)
   - Let employee speak first (less bias)

2. **Manager shares assessment** (20 min)
   - Areas of strength (specific examples)
   - Areas for growth (specific examples)
   - Overall rating (see rubric below)

3. **Discussion** (20 min)
   - Align on performance
   - Discuss growth plan
   - Set next quarter/year goals

4. **Wrap-up** (10 min)
   - Confirm next steps
   - Document key points
   - Schedule next review

**After the review**:
- Document in HR system or Notion/Confluence
- Share summary with employee
- Set follow-up actions (training, projects, etc.)

### Performance Rating Rubric

**Simple 3-point scale** (recommended for small companies):

| Rating | Description | % of Goals Achieved | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Exceeds Expectations** | Consistently goes above and beyond | 90-100% + extra impact | Bonus, promotion consideration |
| **Meets Expectations** | Solid performance, achieves goals | 70-90% | On track, standard raise |
| **Needs Improvement** | Performance below expectations | <70% | Performance improvement plan (PIP) |

**More detailed 5-point scale** (for larger companies):

| Rating | Description | % of Goals | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **5 - Exceptional** | Far exceeds all expectations | 100% + major extra impact | Top bonus, fast-track promotion |
| **4 - Exceeds** | Exceeds most expectations | 90-100% | Above-standard raise, bonus |
| **3 - Meets** | Meets all expectations | 70-90% | Standard raise |
| **2 - Partially Meets** | Some expectations met | 50-70% | PIP, no raise |
| **1 - Does Not Meet** | Expectations not met | <50% | PIP or exit |

**Important**: Most people should be "Meets Expectations" (that's the goal!). "Exceeds" is rare, not the norm.

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

**When to use**: If employee is rated "Needs Improvement" or "Partially Meets".

**PIP structure** (30-60-90 day plan):

```markdown
# Performance Improvement Plan - [Name]

**Start date**: [Date]
**Review date**: [30/60/90 days from start]
**Manager**: [Name]

## Performance Concerns
[Specific areas where performance is below expectations]

**Examples**:
- [Specific example with date/context]
- [Specific example with date/context]

## Improvement Goals
1. [Specific, measurable goal]
   - Success metric: [How we'll measure improvement]
   - Deadline: [Date]
2. [Goal]
3. [Goal]

## Support Provided
- Weekly check-ins with manager
- Training/resources: [List]
- Mentorship: [If applicable]

## Review Process
- **30-day check-in**: [Date] - Review progress on goals
- **60-day check-in**: [Date] - Mid-point assessment
- **90-day review**: [Date] - Final assessment (continue, extend PIP, or exit)

## Acknowledgment
[Employee signature/acknowledgment]
```

**Outcome of PIP**:
- ✅ Improvement shown → Return to "Meets Expectations", continue employment
- ❌ No improvement → Exit (parting ways)

**Important**: PIP should not be a surprise. If performance issues exist, they should be raised in weekly 1:1s first.

## Output-Based Metrics (Not Hours Worked)

### The Problem with Time Tracking

**Traditional thinking**: "If I can't see them working, how do I know they're working?"

**The trap**:
- Install time tracking software (Hubstaff, Time Doctor, etc.)
- Track screenshots, mouse movements, hours logged
- Employees feel surveilled → Trust erodes
- Top performers leave (they don't want to be monitored like children)

**The reality**: Hours worked ≠ productivity.
- Someone can work 60 hours and produce nothing valuable
- Someone can work 30 hours and produce exceptional results

### Output-Based Philosophy

**Core principle**: Measure results, not activity.

**Questions to ask**:
- ✅ "Did you achieve your goals this week/quarter?"
- ✅ "Is the work quality high?"
- ✅ "Are you meeting deadlines?"
- ✅ "Are you unblocking teammates?"

**NOT**:
- ❌ "Did you log 40 hours?"
- ❌ "Were you online from 9-5?"
- ❌ "Did you take too many breaks?"

### Output Metrics by Role

**Engineering**:
- Features shipped (velocity)
- Bugs fixed
- Code review participation
- System uptime/reliability
- Technical debt reduction

**Sales**:
- Revenue closed
- Pipeline generated
- Deals moved to next stage
- Customer satisfaction (NPS)

**Marketing**:
- Leads generated
- Content published (blog posts, campaigns)
- Website traffic
- Conversion rates

**Operations**:
- Projects completed (on time, on budget)
- Process documentation created
- Cost savings identified
- Team efficiency improvements

**Customer Success**:
- Customer retention rate
- Support ticket resolution time
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS)
- Upsells/expansions

**Design**:
- Designs delivered
- User feedback (usability tests)
- Design system contributions
- Cross-team collaboration

**Key principle**: Output metrics should align with goals. If someone's goal is "Reduce support tickets by 20%", track ticket volume, not hours at desk.

### When Time Tracking Makes Sense

**Appropriate uses**:
- ✅ Client billing (consulting, agencies) - need to track billable hours
- ✅ Project estimation - understanding how long tasks take
- ✅ Personal productivity - individual chooses to track for themselves

**Inappropriate uses**:
- ❌ Surveillance - "Are employees really working?"
- ❌ Micromanagement - "Why did you only log 6 hours today?"
- ❌ Distrust - Assuming people aren't working unless proven otherwise

**Tool recommendation**: If you need time tracking for billing, use **Clockify** (free) or **Toggl** ($9/user/month).

For project estimation only, see `guides/07-time-tracking.md`.

## Building Trust in Remote Teams

### The Trust Equation

**Low trust** → Micromanagement → Burnout → Attrition

**High trust** → Autonomy → Motivation → Performance

**How to build trust**:

1. **Default to trust**: Assume people are working unless evidence shows otherwise
2. **Measure output**: Focus on results, not activity
3. **Communicate clearly**: Set expectations (goals, deadlines)
4. **Give autonomy**: Let people manage their own time
5. **Provide feedback**: Regular, specific, actionable

### Trust But Verify

**Trust doesn't mean no accountability**. You still need:
- ✅ Clear goals (so you can measure progress)
- ✅ Regular check-ins (weekly 1:1s)
- ✅ Transparent work (visible in project management tools)
- ✅ Deadlines (commitments are kept)

**If someone is underperforming**:
1. Address it directly in 1:1 (specific examples)
2. Set clear improvement plan
3. Check progress weekly
4. If no improvement → Performance improvement plan (PIP)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Implement surveillance for entire team because one person underperforms
- ❌ Ignore the issue hoping it improves (it won't)

### Remote-Specific Trust Signals

**How employees can build trust remotely**:
- ✅ Proactive communication ("Here's what I'm working on this week")
- ✅ Visible work (updates in project management, Slack)
- ✅ Meeting commitments (deadlines, promises)
- ✅ Asking for help when blocked (not waiting until deadline)
- ✅ Responding to messages within expected time (see `CULTURE.md`)

**How managers can build trust remotely**:
- ✅ Regular 1:1s (never cancel or reschedule carelessly)
- ✅ Clear expectations (goals, deadlines, priorities)
- ✅ Supportive when employee is blocked
- ✅ Flexible on hours/schedule (as long as work gets done)
- ✅ Transparent about company/team direction

---

## Feedback Culture

### Continuous Feedback (Not Just Annual Reviews)

**The problem with annual reviews**: Feedback is 12 months old. Too late to course-correct.

**The solution**: Continuous feedback in weekly 1:1s.

**Types of feedback**:

1. **Positive feedback** (reinforcement):
   - "Great job on the client presentation - your slides were clear and you handled questions well"
   - Give frequently (not just in reviews)
   - Be specific (not just "good job")

2. **Constructive feedback** (improvement):
   - "In yesterday's meeting, you interrupted Sarah twice. Let's work on active listening."
   - Give promptly (within 24-48 hours of event)
   - Be specific, not generic
   - Focus on behavior, not person ("You interrupted" not "You're rude")

3. **Coaching** (skill development):
   - "Let's work on your presentation skills - here are 3 techniques to try"
   - Ongoing, not one-time
   - Supportive, not critical

### Feedback Formula (SBI Model)

**SBI = Situation-Behavior-Impact**

**Structure**:
1. **Situation**: When did this happen? (context)
2. **Behavior**: What did you observe? (specific action)
3. **Impact**: What was the result? (consequence)

**Example (Positive)**:
- Situation: "In Monday's client call..."
- Behavior: "...you proactively asked clarifying questions about their needs"
- Impact: "...which helped us understand their priorities and close the deal faster. Great work!"

**Example (Constructive)**:
- Situation: "In yesterday's team meeting..."
- Behavior: "...you committed to shipping feature X by Friday"
- Impact: "...but it's Friday and it's not done. This blocks the QA team. Let's discuss what happened and how to avoid this."

**Why SBI works**: Specific, actionable, no ambiguity.

### Peer Feedback (Optional, for Larger Teams)

**When to add**: 20+ person company or when introducing 360-degree reviews.

**How it works**:
1. Before performance review, manager requests peer feedback
2. 3-5 peers (colleagues) provide input on employee
3. Manager synthesizes feedback
4. Shares summary in performance review (anonymized)

**Template**:
```markdown
Peer Feedback for [Name]

1. What does [Name] do well?
2. What could [Name] improve?
3. Any specific examples?
```

**Benefits**: Broader perspective, not just manager's view.

**Risks**: Can be political or biased if not done carefully.

---

## Promotion & Career Growth

### Career Conversations (Separate from Performance Reviews)

**Career conversations**: Focused on long-term growth, not quarterly performance.

**Frequency**: 2-3x per year (separate from performance reviews).

**Topics**:
- Where do you want to be in 1-2 years?
- What skills do you want to develop?
- What projects excite you?
- Are you interested in management or staying individual contributor?

**Template**:
```markdown
# Career Conversation - [Name] - [Date]

**Current role**: [Title]

**Career goals** (1-2 years):
- [What does employee want?]

**Skill development**:
- Skills to develop: [List]
- How to develop: [Training, projects, mentorship]

**Growth opportunities**:
- Stretch projects: [What can they take on?]
- Shadowing/mentorship: [Who can they learn from?]

**Potential next role**:
- [Title]
- When: [Timeline]
- Gaps to close: [What's needed to get there?]

**Action items**:
- [ ] [Person] will [action] by [date]
```

### Promotion Criteria

**For promotions to be fair**:
- ✅ Clear criteria (what's needed for next level)
- ✅ Transparent process (how decisions are made)
- ✅ Documented (written promotion doc)

**Simple promotion framework**:

| Level | Scope | Autonomy | Impact | Typical Title |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **L1** | Execute tasks | Needs direction | Individual | Junior |
| **L2** | Own features | Mostly autonomous | Individual + team | Mid-level |
| **L3** | Own projects | Fully autonomous | Team | Senior |
| **L4** | Own systems | Sets direction | Org | Staff / Lead |
| **L5** | Own strategy | Defines vision | Company | Principal / Director |

**Promotion process**:
1. Employee and manager discuss readiness (career conversation)
2. Employee demonstrates next-level work for 3-6 months (trial period)
3. Manager writes promotion doc (evidence of next-level performance)
4. Leadership reviews and approves
5. Promotion announced with updated title and compensation

---

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "I don't know if my remote team is working"

**Symptom**: Manager feels anxious, can't "see" people working.

**Cause**: Used to in-office presence as proxy for productivity.

**Solution**:
1. **Set clear goals** (see Phase 1) - If goals are met, people are working
2. **Weekly check-ins** (see Phase 2) - Regular visibility into progress
3. **Visible work** - Use project management tools (Asana, Linear, ClickUp) so work is transparent
4. **Trust but verify** - Measure output, not hours

**Don't**: Install surveillance software. This destroys trust.

### Pitfall 2: "Performance reviews feel like a surprise"

**Symptom**: Employee didn't know they were underperforming until review.

**Cause**: No regular feedback between reviews.

**Solution**:
1. **Weekly 1:1s** with ongoing feedback (see Phase 2)
2. **No surprises rule**: If someone is at risk of negative review, they should already know from 1:1s
3. **Continuous feedback** (see Feedback Culture above)

### Pitfall 3: "Goals are set but forgotten until review"

**Symptom**: Goals set in Q1, not discussed again until Q4.

**Cause**: No regular check-ins on goal progress.

**Solution**:
1. **Review goals in every 1:1** (5 min weekly check-in)
2. **Update status**: On Track / At Risk / Blocked
3. **Adjust goals if priorities change** (goals aren't set in stone)

### Pitfall 4: "Everyone gets 'Meets Expectations' rating"

**Symptom**: No differentiation in performance reviews (everyone is average).

**Cause**: Manager avoids difficult conversations.

**Solution**:
1. **Be honest**: Top performers deserve recognition, underperformers need improvement plans
2. **Use evidence**: Specific examples, not gut feeling
3. **Normalize distribution**: In healthy teams, 10-20% exceed, 70-80% meet, 10% need improvement

## Tools & Templates

### Recommended Tools

| Purpose | Tool Options | Cost | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------|-------|
| **Goal tracking** | Notion, Confluence, Lattice | Free - $11/user/mo | Notion/Confluence work for most SMBs |
| **1:1 notes** | Notion, Google Docs, Fellow | Free - $8/user/mo | Notion is sufficient for most |
| **Performance reviews** | Lattice, 15Five, Small Improvements | $11-15/user/mo | Overkill for <50 people; use Notion/Sheets |
| **Peer feedback** | Lattice, Culture Amp | $11-15/user/mo | Only for larger teams (50+) |

**Our recommendation for SMBs**: Use **Notion or Confluence** for goals, 1:1s, and reviews. No need for specialized tools until 50+ employees.

### Templates (Use These)

- ✅ **Goal template**: See "Simple Goals Framework" section above
- ✅ **1:1 template**: See `templates/1on1-template.md`
- ✅ **Performance review template**: See "Performance Reviews" section above
- ✅ **Feedback formula**: See "SBI Model" section above

---

## Success Metrics

### Month 1 (Goals Set)
- ✅ Every person has 3-5 goals for quarter
- ✅ Goals are documented in Notion/Confluence
- ✅ Weekly 1:1s scheduled (recurring calendar events)

### Month 3 (Rhythm Established)
- ✅ 90% of 1:1s happen on time (not rescheduled or skipped)
- ✅ Goals reviewed weekly in 1:1s
- ✅ Team reports feeling clear on expectations
- ✅ Managers comfortable giving feedback regularly

### Quarter 1 (First Review Cycle Complete)
- ✅ All employees receive performance review
- ✅ Next quarter goals set
- ✅ No surprises (feedback was ongoing, not just in review)
- ✅ Performance improvement plans in place for underperformers

### Quarter 2+ (Mature System)
- ✅ 70-80% of people achieve goals
- ✅ Career conversations happening 2-3x/year
- ✅ Promotions happen based on clear criteria
- ✅ Team reports high trust and autonomy

---

## Budget Breakdown

**Good news**: Performance management uses existing tools (Notion, Confluence, calendar).

**Cost**: $0 - $15/user/month (if you add specialized tool like Lattice).

**For most SMBs**: $0 (use Notion or Google Docs).

**Time investment**:
- **Goal setting**: 1 hour/person/quarter
- **Weekly 1:1s**: 30 min/person/week = 6 hours/person/quarter
- **Performance reviews**: 1.5 hours/person/quarter
- **Total**: ~9 hours/person/quarter

**For 10-person company**: 90 hours/quarter (23 hours/month) = ~$4,500/quarter in manager time.

**ROI**: Clear goals prevent wasted work. If 10% of work is misaligned, that's **$104k/year** wasted (10 people × 4 hours/week × $50/hour). Investment: $18k/year in manager time. **Net savings: $86k/year** (5x ROI).
