# SEA Employment Compliance Guide

**Last updated**: February 2026

Employment law and compliance requirements for hiring across Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines).

**DISCLAIMER**: This guide provides general information only. Always consult employment lawyers in specific countries before hiring. Employment laws change frequently.

---

## Quick Reference: When You Need This Guide

| Scenario | Read This Section |
|----------|-------------------|
| Hiring first employee in another SEA country | Country-specific requirements + EOR vs entity decision |
| Classifying contractor vs employee | Contractor classification tests (by country) |
| Setting up payroll across SEA | Payroll requirements + providers |
| Understanding termination rules | Notice periods and severance (by country) |
| Offering benefits to remote employees | Mandatory benefits (by country) |

---

## Core Principle: Employment Law is LOCAL

**Critical fact**: Employment law is governed by the country where the employee WORKS, not where your company is registered.

**Example**:
- Your company is registered in Singapore
- You hire a remote employee living in Indonesia
- **Indonesian employment law applies** (not Singapore law)
- You must comply with Indonesian minimum wage, working hours, benefits, termination rules

**Implication**: Hiring across multiple SEA countries means complying with multiple legal systems.

---

## Decision Tree: EOR vs Local Entity

```
Do you have 10+ employees in this country?
├─ YES → Consider setting up local entity
│         (Lower per-employee cost at scale, full control)
│
└─ NO → Use EOR (Employer of Record)
          ├─ Are you testing this market?
          │  └─ YES → Definitely use EOR (flexible, quick to exit)
          │
          └─ Are you committed long-term to this market?
             ├─ YES (and <10 employees) → Still use EOR for simplicity
             └─ NO → Use EOR
```

**EOR cost**: $300-600/employee/month
**Local entity cost**: $5K-20K setup + $2K-10K/year maintenance + $200-400/employee/month payroll

**Break-even**: Usually 10-15 employees in one country

## Part 2: Contractor vs Employee Classification

**Critical**: Misclassifying employees as contractors can result in:
- Back-payment of benefits, taxes, social insurance
- Penalties and fines
- Criminal liability in some countries

### General Tests (Apply in Most SEA Countries)

**Employee indicators**:
- ☑ Works exclusively or primarily for one company
- ☑ Follows company work schedule and procedures
- ☑ Uses company equipment and workspace
- ☑ Receives regular salary (monthly)
- ☑ Company controls HOW work is done (not just WHAT)
- ☑ Integrated into company operations (not independent)
- ☑ Receives training from company
- ☑ Cannot subcontract work to others

**Contractor indicators**:
- ☑ Works for multiple clients
- ☑ Sets own schedule and methods
- ☑ Uses own equipment
- ☑ Invoices for work completed (project-based or hourly)
- ☑ Controls HOW work is done
- ☑ Maintains separate business identity
- ☑ Can subcontract to others
- ☑ Bears own business risk

**General rule**: If 3+ employee indicators apply, likely an EMPLOYEE (not contractor).

---

### Country-Specific Tests

**Singapore**:
- Uses common law "control test"
- Considers: integration, economic reality, mutuality of obligation
- Courts look at totality of circumstances
- **Safe harbor**: Engage contractors via proper service agreements, ensure multiple clients

**Malaysia**:
- Uses "control test" and "integration test"
- Courts consider economic dependence
- **Risk**: High if contractor works exclusively for one company >2 years

**Indonesia**:
- Omnibus Law (2020) allows "PKWT" (fixed-term contracts) for contractors
- But still scrutinizes: exclusivity, integration, equipment
- **Risk**: Very high if misclassified - employee can sue for permanent status + benefits

**Thailand**:
- Uses "control test"
- Considers: payment method, tools, supervision
- **Risk**: Moderate - authorities more lenient for short-term contractors

**Vietnam**:
- Strict on employee classification
- Any work >1 year triggers employee presumption
- **Risk**: High for long-term contractors

**Philippines**:
- "Four-fold test": Selection/engagement, payment of wages, power of dismissal, power of control
- **Risk**: Very high - DOLE actively investigates contractor misclassification
- **Penalties**: Imprisonment + fines for employers

---

### Best Practices for Engaging Contractors

1. **Use written contractor agreements** (not employment contracts)
2. **Ensure contractor has multiple clients** (document this)
3. **Pay via invoice** (not payroll)
4. **Project-based or hourly** (not monthly salary)
5. **No company benefits** (leave, insurance, etc.)
6. **Contractor provides own equipment** (laptop, software, etc.)
7. **Limited to 6-12 months** (renew cautiously beyond this)
8. **No company email address** (use contractor's own business email)

---

## Part 3: Choosing EOR vs Local Entity

### When to Use EOR (Employer of Record)

**Use EOR if**:
- ☑ Hiring 1-10 employees in a country
- ☑ Testing a new market (want flexibility to exit)
- ☑ Want to hire quickly (1-2 weeks vs 2-4 months for entity setup)
- ☑ Don't want to handle local compliance/payroll
- ☑ No plans to establish physical presence

**Pros**:
- Fast setup (1-2 weeks)
- No entity setup costs
- Compliance handled by EOR
- Easy to exit market
- Flexible (add/remove employees easily)

**Cons**:
- Ongoing cost: $300-600/employee/month
- Less control over benefits
- Employee is legally employed by EOR (not your company)

**Recommended EOR providers**: Deel, Remote.com, Oyster (see TOOLS.md for comparison)

---

### When to Set Up Local Entity

**Set up local entity if**:
- ☑ 10+ employees in one country (cost-effective at scale)
- ☑ Long-term commitment to market (5+ years)
- ☑ Need physical presence (office, bank account, local contracts)
- ☑ Industry requires local entity (banking, healthcare, etc.)

**Entity types by country**:

| Country | Common Entity Type | Setup Time | Setup Cost |
|---------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Singapore | Private Limited (Pte Ltd) | 1-2 weeks | $2K-5K |
| Malaysia | Sdn Bhd (Private Limited) | 2-4 weeks | $3K-7K |
| Indonesia | PT PMA (Foreign-owned Limited) | 3-6 months | $10K-20K |
| Thailand | Limited Company | 2-3 months | $5K-10K |
| Vietnam | Limited Liability Company (LLC) | 2-3 months | $5K-15K |
| Philippines | Domestic Corporation | 2-3 months | $3K-10K |

**Ongoing costs** (annual):
- Accounting/audit: $2K-10K
- Corporate secretary: $500-2K
- Annual filing fees: $200-1K
- Payroll processing: $200-400/employee/month

**Break-even analysis**:
- EOR cost: $599/employee/month × 12 months × 10 employees = $71,880/year
- Entity cost: $15K setup + $5K annual + $3K payroll × 10 = $20K first year, $35K subsequent years
- **Break-even**: 10-15 employees

---

## Part 4: Cross-Border Payroll

If NOT using EOR, you'll need payroll providers:

### Regional Payroll Providers (Multi-country)

| Provider | Countries Covered | Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|------|-------|
| **ADP** | All SEA | $15-30/employee | Enterprise-focused |
| **CloudPay** | All SEA | $20-35/employee | Good for 50+ employees |
| **Papaya Global** | All SEA | $650/employee | Expensive, comprehensive |
| **Activpayroll** | All SEA | $15-25/employee | Mid-market focused |

### Country-Specific Providers (See TOOLS.md for details)

- **Singapore**: Talenox, QuickHR, Deskera
- **Malaysia**: PayrollPanda, Talenox, Kakitangan
- **Indonesia**: Gadjian, Talenta, Sleekr
- **Thailand**: FlowAccount, HRMS, Payroll Thailand
- **Vietnam**: VietnamWorks Payroll, TopCV Payroll
- **Philippines**: Sprout Solutions, PayDay, SalaryBox

## Part 5: Remote Work Agreements

### Standard Employment Contract Clauses for Remote Work

Include these in your employment contracts:

**1. Work Location**
- "Employee will work remotely from [City, Country]"
- "Employee may not relocate without prior written consent"

**2. Equipment**
- "Company will provide [laptop, monitor, etc.]"
- "Equipment remains company property and must be returned upon termination"

**3. Working Hours**
- "Employee will be available during [hours] [timezone]"
- "Overtime requires prior approval"

**4. Data Security**
- "Employee must use company-provided VPN when accessing company systems"
- "Employee must not access company data on personal devices"

**5. Governing Law**
- "This agreement is governed by the laws of [Country where employee works]"
- "Disputes will be resolved in [Country] courts"

**6. Termination**
- Standard notice period per local law
- Equipment return procedures
- IP assignment

**Template**: See [templates/remote-work-policy.md](templates/remote-work-policy.md)

---

## Part 6: Tax Considerations

**General principle**: Employee pays taxes in country of residence (where they work).

**Employer obligations**:
- Withhold income tax per local country rules
- Remit to local tax authorities
- File annual tax reports

**Permanent Establishment (PE) risk**:
- Having remote employees in a country MAY create PE (taxable presence)
- Depends on: employee activities, duration, seniority
- **Mitigation**: Use EOR (they become employer, no PE risk to you)
- **Or**: Consult tax advisor for PE assessment

**Example**:
- Your company is registered in Singapore
- You hire a senior employee in Indonesia
- If that employee conducts business on behalf of Singapore company in Indonesia (signs contracts, negotiates deals), you MAY have PE in Indonesia
- Result: Taxable in Indonesia even without local entity

**Advice**: Consult international tax advisors before hiring across borders.

---

## Part 7: Common Compliance Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Assuming your country's laws apply
**Reality**: Employee's country laws apply (not yours)

**Fix**: Understand local requirements BEFORE hiring.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Treating remote employees as contractors to avoid compliance
**Reality**: Classification is based on work relationship, not contract title

**Fix**: Properly classify employees. Use EOR if you want contractor flexibility.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not registering with local authorities
**Reality**: Most countries require employer registration before first hire

**Fix**: Use EOR or hire local HR/legal counsel to handle registration.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting mandatory bonuses (Indonesia THR, Philippines 13th month)
**Reality**: These are LAW, not optional benefits

**Fix**: Budget for 13-14 months salary when hiring in Indonesia/Philippines.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Using standard contracts across countries
**Reality**: Each country has specific required clauses

**Fix**: Use country-specific employment templates (EOR provides these).

---
