## Communication Norms

### Response Time Expectations

| Channel | Response Time | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Slack DM** | Within 2 hours (during working hours) | Quick questions, urgent requests |
| **Slack @mention in team channel** | Within 4 hours (during working hours) | Team discussions, input needed |

**How we use Slack**:
- ✅ Use threads (keep conversations organized)
- ✅ React with emoji (acknowledge messages without "OK" replies)
- ✅ Tag people when you need their input (@person)
- ✅ Use @channel sparingly (true urgency only)
- ❌ Don't DM when channel is more appropriate (transparency)

### Meetings

**Our recurring meetings**:

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Purpose | Required? |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [Daily Standup] | Daily | 15 min | Sync on progress, blockers | [Yes/Optional] |

## Collaboration Norms

### Code Reviews (Engineering Teams)

**What we review**:
- All pull requests (no code ships without review)
- [2 approvals required / 1 approval required]
- [Who can approve: All senior+ engineers / Everyone]

**Review SLA**:
- Reviews completed within [24 hours / 48 hours] of request
- Urgent: Tag reviewer in Slack

**Review culture**:
- ✅ Constructive, specific feedback
- ✅ Ask questions ("Why did you choose X?") not accusations ("This is wrong")
- ✅ Suggest alternatives ("What about Y approach?")
- ✅ Approve even if minor nits (don't block on style preferences)
- ❌ No rubber-stamping (actually read the code)

### Design Reviews (Design Teams)

**What we review**:
- All designs before dev handoff
- Frequency: [Weekly design crit / Ad-hoc when ready]

**Review culture**:

## Work Distribution & Prioritization

### How work is assigned

**Option A: Self-serve from backlog**
- Team pulls tasks from [project management tool]
- Pick based on: Priority labels, your skills, interest
- Communicate in standup: "I'm working on X"

**Option B: Manager assigns**
- Manager assigns tasks in [project management tool]
- Check weekly: Do you have enough work? Too much?

**Our team uses**: [Option A / Option B / Hybrid]

### Prioritization

**Priority levels**:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Drop everything, fix now (system outage, security incident)
- **P1 (High)**: Complete this sprint/cycle
- **P2 (Medium)**: Complete this month
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have, when time allows

**Who sets priorities**:
- Team lead sets P0/P1
- Team discusses P2/P3 in planning meetings

### Capacity & Workload

**Expected capacity**:
- [40 hours/week / Flexible based on goals]
- [X% on planned work, Y% on bugs/support, Z% on learning/improvement]

**If overloaded**:
- Speak up in standup or 1:1
- Manager will help reprioritize or redistribute work
- It's okay to say "I have too much" (we'd rather know!)

---

## Quality Standards

### Definition of Done

A task is "done" when:
- [ ] [Criteria 1 - e.g., Code written and tested]
- [ ] [Criteria 2 - e.g., Code reviewed and approved]
- [ ] [Criteria 3 - e.g., Deployed to production]
- [ ] [Criteria 4 - e.g., Documentation updated]
- [ ] [Criteria 5 - e.g., Stakeholders notified]

**Example** (Engineering):
- [ ] Code written and tests pass
- [ ] Code reviewed (2 approvals)
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

**Example** (Design):
- [ ] Design completed in Figma
- [ ] Design reviewed by team
- [ ] Approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Handed off to engineering (specs, assets)
- [ ] Design documented in design system (if reusable component)

### Quality vs Speed

**Our philosophy**: [Balance quality and speed / Quality first / Speed first]

**Example**:
> We value quality but recognize shipping fast matters too. We aim for "good enough to ship" not "perfect." For P0/P1 work, quality is non-negotiable. For P2/P3, we move fast and iterate.

---

## Feedback & Growth

### Giving Feedback

**Feedback culture**:
- ✅ Regular, not just in reviews (give feedback within 24-48 hours of event)
- ✅ Specific, not generic ("Great job on X because Y" not "Good work")
- ✅ Actionable (what to do differently next time)
- ✅ Balanced (positive + constructive)
- ✅ Private for constructive, public for praise

**How to give feedback**:
- Use SBI model: Situation-Behavior-Impact (see performance management guide)
- Ask: "Can I give you some feedback on X?"
- Example: "In yesterday's meeting, you interrupted Sarah twice, which made it hard for her to finish her point. Next time, let's wait for pauses."

### Receiving Feedback

**How we receive feedback**:
- ✅ Assume positive intent
- ✅ Listen without defensiveness
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions ("Can you give an example?")
- ✅ Thank the person for feedback
- ✅ Reflect and act (don't just dismiss)

### Learning & Development

**Growth opportunities**:
- [Conference budget: $X/person/year]
- [Book budget: $X/person/year]
- [Online courses: Paid for if relevant to role]
- [Lunch & learn: Monthly (team shares learnings)]
- [Pair programming: As needed]

**Career conversations**:
- Frequency: [Quarterly] with manager
- Topics: Long-term goals, skills to develop, potential growth paths

---

## Conflict Resolution

### When conflicts arise

**Step 1: Direct conversation** (person-to-person)
- Talk directly with the person (assume good intent)
- Use "I" statements ("I felt X when Y happened")
- Focus on behavior, not person

**Step 2: Escalate to manager** (if unresolved)
- If direct conversation doesn't work, involve manager
- Manager mediates conversation
- Aim for resolution, not blame

**Step 3: Escalate to HR** (if serious)
- For serious issues (harassment, discrimination, unethical behavior)
- Contact [HR contact]

**Conflict is normal**:
- Healthy teams have disagreements
- We disagree and commit (respectfully debate, then align on decision)
- No silent disagreements (speak up, don't stew)
