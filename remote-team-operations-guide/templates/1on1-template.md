## 1:1 Best Practices

**For Employees**:
- ✅ Add your topics first (24 hours before meeting if possible)
- ✅ Prioritize your topics (most important first)
- ✅ Use this as YOUR time (don't just give status updates - that's what Slack is for)
- ✅ Be honest about challenges (your manager wants to help!)
- ✅ Come with solutions or ideas (not just problems)
- ✅ Follow up on action items

**For Managers**:
- ✅ Let employee drive the agenda (their topics first)
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (70/30 rule)
- ✅ Ask open-ended questions ("How are you feeling about X?" not "Is X done?")
- ✅ Make it safe to raise concerns (no judgment, no defensiveness)
- ✅ Follow up on action items (do what you say you'll do)
- ✅ Never cancel (unless emergency) - signals low priority

**What 1:1s are for**:
- ✅ Career growth conversations
- ✅ Feedback (giving and receiving)
- ✅ Removing blockers
- ✅ Building relationship
- ✅ Discussing challenges or concerns
- ✅ Celebrating wins

**What 1:1s are NOT for**:
- ❌ Status updates (use Slack or async updates)
- ❌ Project management (use project management tool)
- ❌ Task assignment (can happen async)

---

## Red Flags (Signs to Address)

**If employee consistently**:
- ❌ Has no topics (may not feel safe, or doesn't see value)
- ❌ Only gives status updates (not using time effectively)
- ❌ Seems disengaged (low energy, short answers)
- ❌ Avoids discussing challenges (may not feel safe)

**Manager should**:
- Ask: "How can I make 1:1s more useful for you?"
- Dig deeper: "I sense something's off - want to talk about it?"
- Reassure: "This is a safe space - you can share anything"

---

## Quick Status

### Topic 2: Feedback on my design presentation
**Description**: I presented designs to the team on Wednesday. How did it go? Any feedback?

**Type**: Feedback

**Discussion notes**:
- Mike: Great job! Designs were clear, and you handled questions well. One thing: Next time, add context slides upfront (why we're doing this). Some people didn't have full context.
- Sarah: Good point, will do that next time.

---

## Manager Agenda (Mike's Topics)

### Topic 1: New designer joining next week
**Description**: We're hiring a junior designer (starts Monday). Would you be willing to be their buddy (peer mentor)?
