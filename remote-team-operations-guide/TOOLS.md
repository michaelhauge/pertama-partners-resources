## 10. VPN & Security Tools

See [SMB Cybersecurity Guide: Network Security](../smb-cybersecurity-guide/guides/05-network-security.md) for comprehensive VPN comparison.

**Quick recommendations for remote teams**:

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Cloudflare Zero Trust** | Free (up to 50 users) | Budget-conscious teams |
| **NordLayer** | $8/user | Simple VPN for all devices |
| **Tailscale** | Free (up to 100 devices) | Tech teams, peer-to-peer VPN |
| **Perimeter 81** | $8/user | Enterprise features at SMB price |

---

## 11. Payroll (for local entities, NOT EOR)

If you set up local entities and need payroll providers:

### Singapore
| Provider | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Talenox** | $10/employee | Popular with SMEs |
| **QuickHR** | $15/employee | More features |
| **Deskera** | $8/employee | Budget option |

### Malaysia
| Provider | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **PayrollPanda** | $10/employee | Most popular |
| **Talenox** | $10/employee | Also in SG |
| **Kakitangan** | $8/employee | Budget option |

### Indonesia/Thailand/Vietnam/Philippines
**Recommendation**: Use EOR providers (Deel, Remote, Oyster) rather than setting up local payroll. Complexity and compliance risk not worth it for <10 employees per country.

---

## Tool Selection Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Your Needs

Answer these questions:

1. **Company size**: 5-20 / 20-50 / 50-100+ employees?
2. **Current ecosystem**: Google Workspace or Microsoft 365?
3. **Team type**: Tech/startup or traditional/corporate?
4. **Budget**: Aggressive ($20-30/user) or conservative ($40-60/user)?
5. **Cross-border**: Hiring across SEA countries or single country?
6. **Culture**: Async-first or sync-heavy?

### Step 2: Pick Core Stack

**Core = Communication + Video + Project Management + Documentation**

Choose ONE in each category (do NOT overlap):

**Communication**:
- Slack (tech/startup, Google Workspace)
- Teams (corporate, Microsoft 365)

**Video**:
- Zoom (external meetings, universal adoption)
- Teams/Meet (internal, if already in ecosystem)

**Project Management**:
- Linear (engineering teams)
- ClickUp (feature-rich, power users)
- Asana (marketing/ops)
- Monday (visual, simple)
- Notion (all-in-one)

**Documentation**:
- Notion (most SMBs)
- Confluence (if using Jira)

### Step 3: Add Optional Tools

Based on specific needs:

**AI Productivity** (recommended):
- Claude ($20/user)
- Otter.ai ($10/user)

**Performance Management** (if >20 employees):
- 15Five ($4/user)
- Lattice ($8/user)

**Recognition** (if culture concern):
- Donut ($3/user)
- Bonusly ($3/user)

**EOR** (if cross-border):
- Deel, Remote, or Oyster ($599/employee/month)

### Step 4: Calculate Total Cost

**Example: 30-person tech startup**

| Category | Tool | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Communication | Slack Pro | $7.25 × 30 = $217.50 |
| Video | Zoom Pro | $13.33 × 30 = $399.90 |
| Project Management | Linear | $8 × 30 = $240 |
| Documentation | Notion | $10 × 30 = $300 |
| AI Productivity | Claude + Otter | $30 × 30 = $900 |
| Recognition | Donut | $3 × 30 = $90 |
| **Total monthly** | | **$2,147.40** |
| **Per user** | | **$71.58/user/month** |

**ROI Calculation**:
- AI productivity saves: 15 hrs/week × 30 people = 450 hrs/week = 1,800 hrs/month
- Value: 1,800 hrs × $50/hr average = $90,000/month productivity gain
- Cost: $2,147/month
- **ROI**: 42x return

## Common Tool Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using both Slack AND Teams
**Why it's bad**: Team confusion, notification fatigue, information silos

**Fix**: Pick ONE. Use Slack if Google Workspace, Teams if Microsoft 365. Delete the other.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Multiple project management tools
**Why it's bad**: Tasks scattered, no single source of truth, redundant costs

**Fix**: Consolidate to ONE tool. Migrate tasks, sunset old tools.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Time tracking salaried knowledge workers
**Why it's bad**: Destroys trust, measures hours not output, creates surveillance culture

**Fix**: Use output-based accountability (OKRs, weekly updates, 1:1s). Reserve time tracking for billable hours only.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Paying for AI tools individually
**Why it's bad**: $20/user × 30 people = $600/month wasted if only 10 people actively use it

**Fix**:
- Start with 5-10 power users
- Measure adoption and ROI
- Expand to full team only if >60% regular usage

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Using EOR when should use local entity (or vice versa)
**Why it's bad**:
- EOR for 50 employees in one country = $30K/month unnecessarily
- Local entity for 2 employees = months of setup, compliance risk

**Fix**:
- **EOR**: 1-10 employees per country
- **Local entity**: 10+ employees in one country

## Tool Consolidation Worksheet

Use this to audit your current stack:

| Category | Current Tool(s) | # Users | Monthly Cost | Usage % | Keep/Kill |
|----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Communication | | | | | |
| Video | | | | | |
| Project Mgmt | | | | | |
| Documentation | | | | | |
| AI Tools | | | | | |
| Time Tracking | | | | | |
| Other | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | |

**Usage % calculation**: (Active users in last 30 days / Total licenses) × 100

**Kill criteria**: Usage <40% OR redundant with another tool

**Expected savings**: Most companies eliminate $100-500/month by killing redundant tools

---

## Next Steps
