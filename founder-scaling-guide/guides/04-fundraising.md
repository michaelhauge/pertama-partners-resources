# Part 4: Fundraising Strategy — From Bootstrapped to Series B

**The Reality**: Most SEA founders raise too early (before product-market fit, burn cash on failed experiments) or too late (desperate fundraising, bad terms). Fundraising is a tool, not a goal. Only raise when capital accelerates growth faster than it costs.

**This guide covers**:
- When to raise vs when to bootstrap (decision framework)
- How much to raise (by stage: Seed, Series A, Series B)
- Valuation expectations (SEA vs US benchmarks)
- Investor selection strategy (who to approach, in what order)
- Fundraising timeline (3-6 month process breakdown)
- Term sheet negotiation (key terms to watch)

---

## Should You Raise or Bootstrap?

**The fundamental question**: Will $1M investment return >$1M in company value?

### Decision Framework: Raise vs Bootstrap

**Raise if**:
- **Capital accelerates growth**: $1M invested → $5M-$10M company value increase
  - Example: Hire 5 sales reps → 2x revenue growth → fundraise unlocks $10M value
- **Winner-take-all market**: First mover advantage matters (need to grow fast or die)
  - Example: Marketplace (Grab, Gojek), network effects (Slack), land grab (Airbnb)
- **Long time to profitability**: 3-5 years to break even (can't bootstrap)
  - Example: Deep tech, hardware, biotech, enterprise SaaS (long sales cycles)

**Bootstrap if**:
- **Profitable within 6-12 months**: Can fund growth from revenue
  - Example: Agency, consulting, productized services
- **Slow-growth market**: No urgency to scale fast
  - Example: Niche B2B SaaS, lifestyle businesses
- **Founder control matters**: Don't want investors/board oversight
  - Example: Solo founder, opinionated product vision

---

### Case Studies: Raise vs Bootstrap

**Example 1: Should raise** (marketplace, winner-take-all)

**Company**: Food delivery startup in SEA
- **Market**: Winner-take-all (Grab, Gojek, Foodpanda battle)
- **Capital use**: Hire drivers, subsidize orders, build supply
- **Without funding**: Slow growth → competitors win market → company dies
- **With funding**: Fast growth → capture market → exit or IPO

**Decision**: RAISE (capital unlocks network effects)

---

**Example 2: Should bootstrap** (B2B SaaS, profitable fast)

**Company**: SEO tool for SMBs
- **Market**: Fragmented (no network effects, slow-growth)
- **Revenue model**: $50/month SaaS → profitable after 10-20 customers
- **Without funding**: Slow growth (10-20% MoM), profitable in 6 months
- **With funding**: Faster growth (30% MoM), but burn cash for 2 years

**Decision**: BOOTSTRAP (profitability > growth speed)

---

## Fundraising Stages: How Much to Raise

### Pre-Seed / Friends & Family ($50K-$200K)

**What you have**:
- Idea or MVP (no revenue yet)
- 1-2 founders working full-time or part-time
- Maybe early beta testers

**What to raise**: $50K-$200K
- Lower end: Side project → full-time founder (cover living expenses)
- Higher end: Hire 1-2 early employees, build MVP to revenue

**Investor types**:
- Friends & family (easiest, but relationship risk)
- Angel investors (individuals who write $10K-$50K checks)
- Accelerators (Y Combinator, Antler, 500 Global: $100K-$200K for 5-10% equity)

**Valuation**: $500K-$2M (pre-money)

- Metrics: >$500K MRR, <3% monthly churn, >120% NRR, 2-3x revenue growth YoY

**What to raise**: $10M-$30M
- Lower end ($10M-$15M): Expand to new markets (2-3 SEA countries)
- Higher end ($20M-$30M): Expand globally (US, EU) or acquire competitors

**Investor types**:
- Series B VCs (Tiger Global, Insight Partners, GGV Capital)
- Growth equity (focus on profitability path, not just growth)
- Strategic investors (potential acquirers, industry partners)

**Valuation**: $50M-$200M (pre-money)
- SEA median: $100M pre-money
- Raise $20M at $100M pre-money → $120M post-money → investors get 16.7% equity

**Timeline**: 4-6 months

**Key unlock**: Series B unlocks market dominance
- Hire executives (COO, CFO, CTO)
- Expand to 5-10 countries
- Build brand (marketing spend $1M-$5M/year)

---

## Valuation Expectations: SEA vs US

**The valuation gap**: SEA startups are valued 30-50% lower than US equivalents.

### Valuation Benchmarks by Stage (2026)

#### Seed Stage

**US**: $5M-$15M pre-money (median: $10M)
**SEA**: $3M-$10M pre-money (median: $5M)
**Gap**: 50% discount

**Why**: Smaller market (SEA = 700M people vs US = 330M, but lower GDP/capita)

---

#### Series A

**US**: $20M-$80M pre-money (median: $40M)
**SEA**: $15M-$50M pre-money (median: $25M)
**Gap**: 37% discount

**Why**: Exit multiples lower in SEA (5-8x revenue vs 10-15x in US)

---

#### Series B

**US**: $80M-$300M pre-money (median: $150M)
**SEA**: $50M-$200M pre-money (median: $100M)
**Gap**: 33% discount

**Why**: Fewer SEA unicorns (exits <$1B more common)

---

### SEA Valuation by Country

**Singapore**: Highest valuations (close to US, -20%)
- Mature ecosystem, global investor access
- Example: $5M-$10M Seed, $25M-$40M Series A

**Indonesia**: High valuations (-30% vs US)
- Largest market (270M people)
- Example: $4M-$8M Seed, $20M-$35M Series A

**Vietnam**: Moderate valuations (-40% vs US)
- Fast-growing market, improving ecosystem
- Example: $3M-$6M Seed, $15M-$25M Series A

**Philippines/Thailand/Malaysia**: Lower valuations (-50% vs US)
- Smaller markets, less VC capital
- Example: $2M-$5M Seed, $10M-$20M Series A

---

## Investor Selection Strategy

**The mistake**: Pitch every investor (spam approach, low conversion).

**The strategy**: Prioritize investors by fit, warm intro to top 10, pitch in waves.

### Investor Prioritization Framework

**Tier 1: Dream investors** (top 5-10)
- Strong brand (adds credibility for future rounds)
- Relevant expertise (domain knowledge, operational support)
- Portfolio overlap (invested in similar companies, can make intros)
- Lead investor (can write full check, set terms)

**Tier 2: Solid investors** (next 10-20)
- Good brand (respected, but not top-tier)
- Capital available (can participate, but may not lead)
- Geography fit (SEA-focused, local presence)

**Tier 3: Backup investors** (20-30)
- Will invest if others lead (followers, not leaders)
- Smaller checks ($50K-$200K)
- Less value-add (capital only, no operational support)

---

### Investor Research Checklist

Before pitching an investor, research:

**Portfolio**:
- [ ] Have they invested in this space? (B2B SaaS, fintech, marketplace, etc.)
- [ ] Any portfolio companies in SEA?
- [ ] Any portfolio companies at my stage? (Seed, Series A, Series B)
- [ ] Any exits? (IPO, acquisition — or just paper gains?)

**Reputation**:
- [ ] Talk to 2-3 portfolio founders (how helpful is this investor?)
- [ ] Ask: "Would you take their money again?" (filter out bad actors)
- [ ] Check Glassdoor/LinkedIn for investor track record

**Investment thesis**:
- [ ] Read blog posts, tweets, interviews (understand what they look for)
- [ ] Identify "hooks" (why your company fits their thesis)

---

### Warm Intro Strategy

**Cold emails**: 1-2% response rate (98% ignored)
**Warm intros**: 30-50% response rate (investors trust referrals)

**How to get warm intros**:
1. **Portfolio founders**: Best intro (investor trusts their judgment)
   - Reach out to founders in investor's portfolio: "Would you intro me to [investor]?"
2. **Other investors**: Second-best (investors trust each other)
   - Ask current investors: "Who should I talk to for Series A?"
3. **Advisors/mentors**: Decent (if they're well-connected)
4. **LinkedIn 2nd-degree connections**: Weakest warm intro, but better than cold

**Email template** (ask for intro):
```
Subject: Quick intro request — [Investor Name]

Hi [Founder/Investor],

Hope you're doing well! I'm raising a Series A for [Company] (B2B SaaS, $2M ARR, 30% MoM growth).

I'd love an intro to [Investor Name] at [VC Firm] — I see they invested in [Portfolio Company], which is similar to what we're building.

Happy to send you a blurb to forward. Let me know if you're open to connecting us!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

## Fundraising Timeline (3-6 Months)

**The process**: Fundraising is a sales process (qualify leads, pitch, negotiate, close).

### Month 1-2: Preparation

**Week 1-2: Build materials**
- [ ] Pitch deck (10-15 slides, tell a story)
- [ ] Financial model (3-year projections, unit economics)
- [ ] Data room (financials, contracts, metrics dashboard)
- [ ] One-pager (1-page summary for email intros)

**Week 3-4: Investor research**
- [ ] Build list of 50-100 investors (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- [ ] Prioritize top 10-20 (dream investors)
- [ ] Request warm intros (reach out to portfolio founders, advisors)

---

### Month 3-4: Pitching (Wave 1)

**Week 5-8: Pitch top 10 investors**
- [ ] Schedule intro meetings (30-60 min calls)
- [ ] Send pitch deck 24 hrs before meeting
- [ ] Follow up within 24 hrs after meeting (send data, answer questions)

**Goal**: Get 2-3 investors interested (request partner meetings, due diligence)

**Pass rate**: 50-70% will pass after first meeting (expect rejection)

---

### Month 4-5: Due Diligence

**Week 9-12: Investors deep-dive**
- [ ] Partner meetings (pitch to full partnership, 2-5 partners)
- [ ] Reference calls (investors talk to customers, employees, advisors)
- [ ] Financial audit (review contracts, revenue, unit economics)
- [ ] Legal review (incorporation docs, IP, cap table)

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks per investor

**Pass rate**: 30-50% will pass after due diligence (expect more rejection)

---

### Month 5-6: Term Sheets & Closing

**Week 13-16: Negotiate terms**
- [ ] Receive term sheet (1-2 weeks after partner meeting)
- [ ] Negotiate key terms (valuation, board seats, liquidation preference)
- [ ] Legal diligence (lawyers review term sheet, draft final docs)
- [ ] Sign docs (wire transfer, close round)

**Timeline**: 3-6 weeks from term sheet to close

---

### Fundraising Math: How Many Investors to Pitch?

**Funnel**:
- 50 investors contacted
- → 20 intro meetings (40% conversion)
- → 8 partner meetings (40% conversion)
- → 3 term sheets (37% conversion)
- → 1 close (33% conversion)

**Takeaway**: Need to pitch 50+ investors to close 1 round.

---

## Pitch Deck Structure (10-15 Slides)

### Slide 1: Title

**What to include**:
- Company name
- One-line description ("Stripe for SEA" or "AI-powered accounting for SMBs")
- Your name, title, contact

---

### Slide 2: Problem

**What to include**:
- Describe the pain point (what sucks today?)
- Quantify the problem (how much does this cost customers?)
- Show you deeply understand the customer

**Example**:
> "SEA SMBs spend 20-40 hours/month on manual accounting (bookkeeping, invoicing, tax filing). This costs $500-$2K/month in labor, plus $10K-$50K in tax penalties from errors."

---

### Slide 3: Solution

**What to include**:
- Describe your product (what does it do?)
- Show the "aha moment" (screenshot or demo)
- Explain why it's 10x better (faster, cheaper, easier)

**Example**:
> "Our AI-powered accounting platform automates 80% of bookkeeping (invoice categorization, reconciliation, tax filing). SMBs save 15-30 hrs/month, reduce errors by 90%, and stay compliant."

---

### Slide 4: Traction

**What to include**:
- Revenue chart (MRR growth over time)
- Key metrics (ARR, customers, churn, NRR)
- Growth rate (MoM % growth, YoY growth)

**Example**:
> "$2M ARR (from $500K 12 months ago), 200 customers, 3% monthly churn, 110% NRR, 25% MoM growth"

---

### Slide 5: Market Size

**What to include**:
- TAM (Total Addressable Market): How big is the total market?
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): How much can you realistically capture?
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): How much can you capture in 3-5 years?

**Example**:
> "TAM: $50B (all SMB accounting software globally), SAM: $5B (SEA SMBs), SOM: $500M (10% market share in 5 years)"

---

### Slide 6: Business Model

**What to include**:
- Revenue model (subscription, transaction fee, usage-based)
- Pricing ($X/month per user or % of transaction value)
- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period, gross margin)

**Example**:
> "SaaS subscription: $50-$200/month per company. CAC: $500, LTV: $3,000, Payback: 10 months, Gross margin: 85%"

---

### Slide 7: Competition

**What to include**:
- List competitors (direct and indirect)
- Positioning (2x2 matrix or comparison table)
- Why you win (unique advantage, moat)

**Example**:
> "Competitors: Xero (expensive, $50/month), QuickBooks (complex, 50-hour learning curve), Manual (slow, 20 hrs/month). We're 10x faster (AI automation), 50% cheaper ($25/month), and SEA-focused (multi-currency, PDPA-compliant)."

---

### Slide 8: Go-to-Market Strategy

**What to include**:
- Customer acquisition channels (SEO, paid ads, partnerships, sales)
- Sales process (self-serve vs sales-led)
- Expansion strategy (start in SG, expand to MY/ID/TH)

**Example**:
> "Self-serve SaaS with PLG motion. Acquire via SEO (60% of traffic), Google Ads (30%), referrals (10%). Expand: SG → MY → ID → TH/VN/PH over 18 months."

---

### Slide 9: Team

**What to include**:
- Founders (names, roles, relevant backgrounds)
- Key hires (VPs, advisors)
- Why this team will win (domain expertise, execution track record)

**Example**:
> "CEO: Jane (ex-PwC, 10 years accounting experience), CTO: John (ex-Stripe, built payments infra), CFO: Sarah (ex-Grab, scaled finance from $10M-$100M ARR)"

---

### Slide 10: Financials

**What to include**:
- 3-year projections (revenue, expenses, gross margin, burn)
- Path to profitability (when will you break even?)
- Use of funds (how will you spend the raise?)

**Example**:
> "Current: $2M ARR, $150K/month burn. Raise $5M → 24-month runway. Plan: Hire 10 sales reps ($2M), 5 engineers ($1M), marketing ($1M), ops ($1M). Target: $10M ARR in 24 months, break even at Month 18."

---

### Slide 11: Ask

**What to include**:
- How much are you raising? ($XM Series A)
- What will you use it for? (sales, engineering, marketing)
- What milestones will you hit? ($10M ARR, 50K customers, expand to 5 countries)

**Example**:
> "Raising $5M Series A to scale go-to-market. Plan: Hire 10 sales reps, expand to Malaysia and Indonesia, hit $10M ARR in 24 months."

---

## Term Sheet Negotiation: Key Terms

**The mistake**: Founders focus only on valuation (but terms matter more than price).

### Key Term 1: Valuation

**Pre-money vs post-money**:
- **Pre-money**: Valuation before investment
- **Post-money**: Valuation after investment

**Example**:
- Raise $5M at $20M pre-money
- Post-money valuation: $20M + $5M = $25M
- Investor ownership: $5M ÷ $25M = 20%

**Negotiation tip**: High valuation ≠ good deal (terms matter more)

---

### Key Term 2: Liquidation Preference

**What it is**: Investors get paid first in an exit (before founders/employees)

**Types**:
- **1x non-participating** (STANDARD): Investor gets back $1 per $1 invested, then shares remaining proceeds
  - Example: Invest $5M, exit at $30M → investor gets $5M + (20% × $25M) = $10M
- **1x participating** (FOUNDER-UNFRIENDLY): Investor gets $1 per $1 invested, PLUS their ownership %
  - Example: Invest $5M, exit at $30M → investor gets $5M + (20% × $30M) = $11M
- **2x non-participating** (VERY BAD): Investor gets $2 per $1 invested
  - Example: Invest $5M, exit at $30M → investor gets $10M + (20% × $20M) = $14M

**Negotiation tip**: Always push for 1x non-participating (standard in SEA, participating is US-style and founder-unfriendly)

---

### Key Term 3: Board Seats

**What it is**: Who controls the board (and thus the company)

**Typical board composition**:
- 2 founder seats (CEO + 1 co-founder)
- 2 investor seats (lead investor + Series A investor)
- 1 independent seat (mutually agreed upon)

**Board voting**:
- Majority vote (3 of 5) required for major decisions (raise money, hire/fire CEO, sell company)

**Negotiation tip**: Founders should maintain board control until Series B (3 founder seats, 2 investor seats)

---

### Key Term 4: Anti-Dilution Protection

**What it is**: Protects investors if you raise at a lower valuation next round (down round)

**Types**:
- **Full ratchet** (VERY BAD): Investor gets re-priced to new lower valuation (massive dilution to founders)
- **Weighted average** (STANDARD): Investor gets partial protection (proportional to new shares issued)
- **None** (RARE): No protection

**Example** (full ratchet, BAD):
- Series A: Raise $5M at $25M post ($1.00/share)
- Series B: Raise $10M at $20M post ($0.50/share) — DOWN ROUND
- Full ratchet: Series A investor's $1.00 shares get re-priced to $0.50 → their ownership doubles
- Founder dilution: Massive (founders go from 60% → 40% without raising more money)

**Negotiation tip**: Only accept weighted average (standard), never accept full ratchet

---

### Key Term 5: Drag-Along Rights

**What it is**: Investors can force founders to sell company (if >50% of investors vote to sell)

**Why it matters**: Prevents founders from blocking exits

**Example**:
- Investor receives acquisition offer ($100M)
- Founder wants to keep building (target $1B)
- Drag-along: Investor can force sale (founder must sell)

**Negotiation tip**: Acceptable if threshold is high (>66% of shareholders must approve)

---

### Key Term 6: Vesting on Founder Shares

**What it is**: Founders must re-vest their equity over 4 years (even if they founded the company)

**Why investors want this**: Protects against founder departure (if founder quits, investors don't lose 50% of company)

**Standard vesting**: 4 years with 1-year cliff
- If founder quits before 12 months: Gets 0%
- After 12 months: Gets 25%, then monthly vesting for remaining 75%

**Negotiation tip**: If you've been building for 2 years before raising, negotiate for "accelerated vesting credit" (start vesting at Year 2, not Year 0)

---

## Fundraising Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Raising Too Early

**The mistake**: Raise before product-market fit (use funding to "figure it out")

**Why it's bad**:
- Burn cash on failed experiments (pivot 3-4 times, run out of money)
- Bad terms (desperate for capital, accept unfavorable terms)
- Pressure to grow fast (before you're ready)

**When to raise**: After product-market fit (10-20% MoM growth, <5% churn, clear path to $1M ARR)

---

### Mistake 2: Raising Too Much

**The mistake**: Raise $10M when you only need $5M (bigger is better mentality)

**Why it's bad**:
- Over-dilution (give up 30-40% when you only needed to give up 15-20%)
- High expectations (investors expect 10x return, not 3x)
- Pressure to spend (burn cash to justify valuation)

**How much to raise**: 18-24 months of runway (enough to hit next milestone + 6-month buffer)

---

### Mistake 3: Optimizing for Valuation Only

**The mistake**: Take highest valuation offer (ignore terms, investor quality)

**Why it's bad**:
- Bad terms (participating preferred, 2x liquidation preference, full ratchet)
- Bad investor (no support, fights over decisions, reputation risk)
- Down round risk (if you raise at $50M but only worth $30M, next round is painful)

**What to optimize for**: Valuation + terms + investor quality

---

### Mistake 4: No Fundraising Timeline

**The mistake**: Pitch investors randomly (no urgency, no momentum)

**Why it's bad**:
- Slow process (6-12 months to close)
- No competition (investors don't feel FOMO)
- Bad terms (investors have leverage, "only game in town")

**Strategy**: Create urgency (pitch 10-20 investors simultaneously, create FOMO)

---

### Mistake 5: Fundraising When Desperate

**The mistake**: Wait until 3 months of runway left (desperate mode)

**Why it's bad**:
- Bad terms (investors know you're desperate)
- Weak negotiating position (can't say no to bad deals)
- High stress (founders burned out, can't focus on business)

**When to fundraise**: Start when you have 9-12 months of runway (plenty of time, not desperate)

---

## SEA-Specific Fundraising Considerations

### Country-by-Country Fundraising Landscape

#### Singapore

**Investor ecosystem**: Mature (30+ active VCs, government support)

**Key investors**:
- Sequoia India, Accel, Lightspeed (US VCs with SEA presence)
- Golden Gate Ventures, Jungle Ventures, Openspace (regional VCs)
- Temasek, GIC (government-linked investors)

**Valuation premium**: Highest in SEA (close to US)

**Fundraising timeline**: 3-6 months (fast, many investors)

---

#### Indonesia

**Investor ecosystem**: Growing (20+ active VCs, largest market in SEA)

**Key investors**:
- East Ventures, Alpha JWC, MDI Ventures (local VCs)
- Sequoia, Accel, Tiger Global (US VCs active in Indonesia)
- Go-Ventures, Grab Ventures (corporate VCs)

**Valuation**: 10-20% discount vs Singapore

**Fundraising timeline**: 4-6 months (slower due diligence)

---

#### Vietnam

**Investor ecosystem**: Emerging (10-15 active VCs)

**Key investors**:
- 500 Global, Jungle Ventures (regional VCs)
- VinaCapital, Venturra (local VCs)

**Valuation**: 20-30% discount vs Singapore

**Fundraising timeline**: 6-9 months (less mature ecosystem)

---

#### Malaysia / Thailand / Philippines

**Investor ecosystem**: Early-stage (5-10 active VCs per country)

**Key investors**:
- 500 Global, Gobi Partners (regional VCs)
- Cradle Fund (Malaysia government), SCB 10X (Thailand), Kickstart Ventures (Philippines)

**Valuation**: 30-40% discount vs Singapore

**Fundraising timeline**: 6-12 months (fewer investors, slower process)

---

4. **Pitch 50+ investors to close 1 round** (expect 70-90% rejection rate)

5. **Terms matter more than valuation** (1x non-participating liquidation preference, weighted average anti-dilution)

6. **Start fundraising when you have 9-12 months of runway** (not 3 months — desperate fundraising = bad terms)

7. **Create FOMO by pitching 10-20 investors simultaneously** (urgency drives better terms)
