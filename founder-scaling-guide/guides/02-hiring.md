# Part 2: Hiring & Team Building — The $1M to $10M Journey

**The Reality**: Bad hires are the most expensive scaling mistake. A mis-hired VP costs $200K-$500K (salary + equity + opportunity cost + 6-12 months to fix). Most SEA founders under-hire (stay scrappy too long) or over-hire (burn cash on premature executives).

**This guide covers**:
- How to hire A-players consistently (vs settling for B-players)
- Navigating the 40-person wall (when to add middle management)
- Equity compensation for first 50 hires (SEA market rates)
- When to hire COO, CFO, CTO, VP roles (by ARR stage)
- Local vs offshore hiring (cost arbitrage strategies for SEA)
- Remote vs co-located team structures

---

## The 3-Stage Hiring Evolution

### Stage 1: Generalists ($0-$1M ARR, 1-15 employees)

**Hiring profile**: Scrappy generalists who "figure it out"

**Key traits**:
- Comfortable with ambiguity and rapid change
- Willing to do unglamorous work (customer support, data entry, manual processes)
- Low ego (no title obsession)
- Fast learners (pick up new tools quickly)

**What NOT to hire**:
- ❌ Specialists (too narrow, can't wear multiple hats)
- ❌ Big company refugees (expect processes/resources you don't have)
- ❌ Title-obsessed candidates (need VP/Director titles for basic roles)

**Compensation strategy**:
- Salary: Below-market (60-80% of market rate)
- Equity: Above-market (0.5-2% for first 10 hires)
- Pitch: "Join early, get meaningful equity, shape the company"

**Example roles**:
- Employee #1-5: "Founding team member" (ops/sales/eng/marketing generalist)
- Employee #6-10: "Senior X" (more specialized, but still flexible)
- Employee #11-15: First specialists (dedicated customer success, dedicated eng)

---

### Stage 2: Specialists + First Managers ($1M-$3M ARR, 15-40 employees)

**Hiring profile**: Specialists who can build processes, plus first-time managers

**Key challenge**: The 40-person wall
- At 30-40 employees, founders can't manage everyone directly
- Need to add middle management layer (Team Leads, Managers)
- This is HARD — most founders resist (fear of bureaucracy, loss of control)

**What to hire**:
- ✅ Specialists with 3-5 years experience (can own a function independently)
- ✅ First-time managers from high-growth startups (promoted from IC → Manager recently)
- ✅ Domain experts (sales, marketing, product, eng specializations)

**What NOT to hire**:
- ❌ Expensive VPs/Directors too early (premature, burn cash)
- ❌ Career managers from corporates (process-heavy, slow-moving)
- ❌ Consultants (good at analysis, bad at execution)

**Compensation strategy**:
- Salary: At-market (80-100% of market rate)
- Equity: Below-market (0.1-0.5% for hires #15-40)
- Pitch: "Join growth-stage startup, become manager/leader soon"

**Example roles**:
- Engineering: Frontend/Backend/DevOps specialists (not full-stack generalists)
- Sales: BDR → AE → CSM specialization (dedicated roles)
- Product: Product Manager (owns roadmap, talks to customers)
- Operations: Finance/HR/Legal specialists (first professional ops hires)

---

### Stage 3: Executives + Scaled Teams ($3M-$10M ARR, 40-100 employees)

**Hiring profile**: Experienced executives who've "done it before" at scale

**What to hire**:
- ✅ VP/Director-level executives with experience scaling $5M-$50M ARR companies
- ✅ Managers who can build teams (hire 5-10 people, develop them)
- ✅ Senior ICs (Staff Engineer, Principal Designer, etc.) for deep expertise

**Critical executive hires** (by ARR stage):
- **$3M ARR**: VP Sales (scale go-to-market, build sales team 5-15 reps)
- **$5M ARR**: VP Engineering (manage 15-30 eng, architect for scale)
- **$5M ARR**: Head of Product (own product roadmap, PM team 2-5 people)
- **$7M ARR**: CFO or VP Finance (fundraising, financial planning, unit economics)
- **$7M ARR**: COO (operations, customer success, finance, legal)

**What NOT to hire**:
- ❌ C-suite executives too early ($1M-$3M ARR is too early for COO/CFO)
- ❌ Big Tech refugees ($500K+ comp expectations, slow execution pace)
- ❌ "Professional executives" who've never been at startups (culture mismatch)

**Compensation strategy**:
- Salary: At-market or above (100-120% of market rate for proven executives)
- Equity: Market-rate (0.5-2% for VPs, 0.05-0.2% for senior ICs)
- Cash bonus: Performance-based (10-30% of base salary)

---

## A-Player vs B-Player Framework

**The 80/20 rule**: A-players are 5-10x more productive than B-players (not 20% better — 500-1000% better). One A-player VP Sales can outperform 3 B-player Account Execs.

### How to Identify A-Players

**During interviews, A-players**:
- ✅ Ask smart questions about the business (market size, unit economics, competitive landscape)
- ✅ Reference specific metrics/outcomes from past roles ("grew MRR from $500K to $3M in 18 months")
- ✅ Admit mistakes and explain what they learned ("we over-hired too early, burned $2M")
- ✅ Show curiosity about problems, not just titles ("What's the biggest bottleneck right now?")

**Red flags (B-players or worse)**:
- ❌ Obsessed with title/comp before understanding the role ("What's the salary range?")
- ❌ Vague about past achievements ("I helped grow the company", "We did well")
- ❌ Blame others for failures ("My manager didn't give me resources", "The team wasn't good")
- ❌ No questions about the business (just focused on perks, WFH policy, vacation days)

### The "Would I Want This Person as CEO?" Test

**Question to ask yourself**: If I had to step down tomorrow, would I trust this person to run the company?

- If **YES** → A-player (hire immediately)
- If **MAYBE** → B-player (might hire for IC role, not manager)
- If **NO** → C-player (pass, no matter how desperate you are)

---

## Navigating the 40-Person Wall

**The problem**: At 30-40 employees, founders hit a breaking point:
- Too many direct reports (10-15 people reporting to founder)
- Communication silos form (teams don't talk to each other)
- Founder becomes bottleneck (every decision requires founder approval)
- Burnout risk increases (founder working 80-100 hour weeks)

**The solution**: Add middle management layer (Team Leads, Managers)

### When to Add Middle Management

**Trigger conditions** (any 2 of these = time to add managers):
- Founder has >10 direct reports
- Founder is working >70 hours/week consistently
- Team velocity slowing down (projects taking 2-3x longer than expected)
- High employee turnover (>15% annual churn)
- Founder missing important meetings/decisions due to overload

**How to add managers** (3 options):

**Option 1: Promote from within** (BEST for most startups)
- Promote your best IC to Team Lead/Manager
- Pros: Knows the company, culture fit, fast onboarding
- Cons: First-time manager (needs coaching, makes mistakes)
- Best for: Engineering, Product, Customer Success

**Option 2: Hire experienced manager** (GOOD for specialized functions)
- Hire someone who's managed 5-10 people before
- Pros: Experienced, can build team/processes independently
- Cons: Expensive, slower culture fit, may over-process
- Best for: Sales, Marketing, Finance/Ops

**Option 3: Hire VP/Director to build team** (RISKY before $3M ARR)
- Hire executive who will hire their own team
- Pros: Fast team-building, experienced leadership
- Cons: Very expensive, high failure rate (50%+ of VP hires fail in first year)
- Best for: Sales at $3M+ ARR, Engineering at $5M+ ARR

### First-Time Manager Playbook

**If you promote from within**, follow this 90-day onboarding:

**Month 1: Learn to manage (basics)**
- Week 1-2: Read "The Manager's Path" by Camille Fournier
- Week 3-4: Shadow founder doing 1-on-1s, performance reviews, hiring interviews

**Month 2: Start managing (with training wheels)**
- Week 5-6: Run first 1-on-1s with direct reports (founder observes first 2)
- Week 7-8: Make first hiring decision (with founder approval)

**Month 3: Manage independently (with check-ins)**
- Week 9-10: Deliver first performance reviews (founder reviews feedback before delivery)
- Week 11-12: Run first team offsite/planning session

**Common first-time manager mistakes**:
- ❌ **Too hands-off** ("I don't want to micromanage, so I'll leave them alone")
  - Result: Team lacks direction, misses deadlines, poor work quality
  - Fix: Weekly 1-on-1s, clear goals, regular feedback
- ❌ **Too hands-on** ("I'll review every line of code/copy/design")
  - Result: Team becomes dependent, manager becomes bottleneck
  - Fix: Delegate outcomes, not tasks ("Ship feature X by Friday" not "Write code like this")
- ❌ **Avoiding conflict** ("I don't want to give negative feedback, it might hurt morale")
  - Result: Poor performers stay, A-players get frustrated and quit
  - Fix: Deliver feedback within 24 hours, be direct but kind

## Equity Compensation: SEA Market Rates (2026)

**The equity dilemma**: Offer too much equity → dilute founders unnecessarily. Offer too little → can't attract A-players.

### Equity Benchmarks by Role (at $1M ARR)

**Founding team (first 5 hires)**:
- Employee #1: 1.0-3.0% (critical early hire, takes huge risk)
- Employee #2-3: 0.5-1.5%
- Employee #4-5: 0.25-0.75%

**Early team (hires #6-20)**:
- Senior IC (Senior Engineer, Senior Designer): 0.15-0.5%
- Mid-level IC (Engineer, Marketer, Salesperson): 0.05-0.25%
- Junior IC (entry-level): 0.01-0.1%

**Growth stage team (hires #21-50)**:
- VP/Director (first executive hire): 0.5-2.0%
- Senior IC: 0.1-0.3%
- Mid-level IC: 0.025-0.15%
- Junior IC: 0.005-0.05%

**Scaled team (hires #51-100)**:
- C-suite executive (COO, CFO, CTO): 1.0-3.0%
- VP/Director: 0.25-1.0%
- Manager/Team Lead: 0.05-0.25%
- Senior IC: 0.025-0.15%
- Mid-level IC: 0.01-0.05%

### Equity Vesting Schedule

**Standard vesting**: 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- Year 1: 0% vests (if employee quits before 12 months, gets nothing)
- Month 13: 25% vests (1-year cliff)
- Months 14-48: Remaining 75% vests monthly (2.08% per month)

**Accelerated vesting triggers** (optional):
- Single-trigger acceleration: If company is acquired, 50-100% vests immediately
- Double-trigger acceleration: If company is acquired AND employee is terminated, 100% vests

**Example**:
- Employee hired Jan 1, 2026 with 0.5% equity (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- Jan 1, 2027: 25% vests (0.125% of company)
- Feb 1, 2027: 2.08% additional vests (0.0104% of company)
- ...every month until Jan 1, 2030 (100% vested)

### SEA Market Rates: Salary + Equity Trade-offs

**High salary, low equity** (corporate-style):
- Salary: 100-120% of market rate
- Equity: 0.01-0.1% (minimal equity)
- Best for: Risk-averse candidates from corporates, later-stage hires (#50-100)

**Balanced** (startup standard):
- Salary: 80-100% of market rate
- Equity: 0.05-0.5% (moderate equity)
- Best for: Most startup hires (#10-50)

**Low salary, high equity** (early-stage startup):
- Salary: 60-80% of market rate
- Equity: 0.25-2.0% (meaningful equity)
- Best for: First 10 hires who believe in the mission and want upside

**Example trade-off**:
- **Option A**: $120K salary + 0.05% equity (safe, low upside)
- **Option B**: $80K salary + 0.5% equity (risky, 10x upside potential)
- At $100M exit: Option A = $50K equity value, Option B = $500K equity value

## When to Hire Executives (COO, CFO, VP Sales)

**The mistake**: Hiring executives too early burns cash and creates overhead. Wait until you have real need + budget.

### VP Sales (hire at $2M-$3M ARR)

**When to hire**:
- ARR: $2M-$3M
- Sales team: 3-5 AEs (founder can't manage more)
- Sales cycle: Repeatable (not founder magic, any AE can close)

**What they do**:
- Build sales team (hire 10-20 reps over 12-24 months)
- Implement sales process (playbooks, CRM, forecasting)
- Own revenue target (hit $5M-$10M ARR in 18-24 months)

**Compensation** (SEA market):
- Salary: $120K-$180K base
- Equity: 0.5-1.5%
- Bonus: 30-50% of base (tied to revenue targets)

**Red flags** (bad VP Sales candidates):
- ❌ No track record of scaling $2M → $10M ARR
- ❌ Only sold in one market (can't adapt to SEA nuances)
- ❌ Focused on strategy, not execution ("I'll hire sellers to do the work")

---

### VP Engineering / CTO (hire at $3M-$5M ARR)

**When to hire**:
- ARR: $3M-$5M
- Eng team: 10-15 engineers (founder can't manage architecture + people)
- Technical debt: Accumulating (need someone to manage tech roadmap)

**What they do**:
- Architect for scale (design systems for 10x user growth)
- Build eng team (hire 20-40 engineers over 12-24 months)
- Manage technical roadmap (balance new features vs tech debt)

**Compensation** (SEA market):
- Salary: $150K-$250K base
- Equity: 1.0-3.0%
- Bonus: 10-20% of base (tied to product delivery)

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Pure architect (no people management experience)
- ❌ Big Tech background only (used to unlimited resources)
- ❌ No startup experience (can't operate with constraints)

---

### CFO / VP Finance (hire at $5M-$7M ARR)

**When to hire**:
- ARR: $5M-$7M
- Fundraising: Raising Series A/B (need financial models, board reporting)
- Unit economics: Complex (multiple products, pricing tiers, currencies)

**What they do**:
- Lead fundraising (build models, pitch investors, negotiate terms)
- Financial planning (budgets, forecasts, scenario modeling)
- Board reporting (monthly/quarterly board decks, investor updates)

**Compensation** (SEA market):
- Salary: $150K-$220K base
- Equity: 0.5-2.0%
- Bonus: 10-20% of base (tied to fundraising/financial goals)

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Accounting background only (CFO ≠ accountant)
- ❌ No fundraising experience (can't pitch investors)
- ❌ Corporate finance only (can't operate with startup pace)

---

### COO (hire at $7M-$10M ARR)

**When to hire**:
- ARR: $7M-$10M
- Team: 50-80 employees (founder can't manage all functions)
- Complexity: Multiple departments (sales, CS, ops, finance, legal)

**What they do**:
- Run day-to-day operations (free up founder to focus on vision/fundraising/product)
- Own non-product functions (sales, CS, finance, HR, legal)
- Scale processes (hiring, onboarding, performance management)

**Compensation** (SEA market):
- Salary: $180K-$280K base
- Equity: 1.0-3.0%
- Bonus: 20-30% of base (tied to operational metrics)

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Consultant background (good at analysis, bad at execution)
- ❌ Corporate operations only (too process-heavy for startup)
- ❌ Never been at high-growth startup (can't operate at startup pace)

---

## Local vs Offshore Hiring: Cost Arbitrage Strategies

**The opportunity**: Hire offshore talent at 30-50% cost savings vs local SEA hires.

### Cost Comparison (Monthly Salary, USD)

#### Engineering

**Senior Engineer**:
- Singapore: $8K-$12K
- Malaysia/Thailand: $4K-$6K
- Indonesia/Philippines: $2K-$4K
- Vietnam: $2K-$4K
- India (Bangalore): $2K-$5K
- Eastern Europe (Poland): $4K-$7K

**Mid-level Engineer**:
- Singapore: $5K-$8K
- Malaysia/Thailand: $2.5K-$4K
- Indonesia/Philippines: $1.5K-$2.5K
- Vietnam: $1.5K-$2.5K
- India: $1.5K-$3K
- Eastern Europe: $3K-$5K

#### Sales & Customer Success

**Account Executive**:
- Singapore: $5K-$8K base (+ commission)
- Malaysia/Thailand: $2.5K-$4K base
- Indonesia/Philippines: $1.5K-$2.5K base
- Vietnam: $1.5K-$2.5K base

**Customer Success Manager**:
- Singapore: $4K-$6K
- Malaysia/Thailand: $2K-$3.5K
- Indonesia/Philippines: $1K-$2K
- Vietnam: $1K-$2K

#### Operations & Support

**Customer Support**:
- Singapore: $3K-$4K
- Philippines: $800-$1.5K (English proficiency advantage)
- Indonesia: $800-$1.2K
- Vietnam: $600-$1K

---

### Cost Arbitrage Strategy by Function

**Offshore-friendly roles** (30-50% cost savings):
- ✅ Engineering (frontend, backend, mobile, QA)
- ✅ Customer Support (24/7 support, English-speaking)
- ✅ Data entry / Operations (manual tasks, process execution)
- ✅ Design (UI/UX, graphic design)
- ✅ Content / Marketing (content writing, SEO, social media)

**Local-only roles** (must be in same timezone/market as customers):
- ❌ Sales (need to visit customers, understand local market)
- ❌ Customer Success (need real-time communication, cultural fluency)
- ❌ Executive team (COO, CFO, VP Sales — need to be on-site)

**Hybrid approach** (mix of local + offshore):
- Local: Sales, CS, Product, Executives (20-30% of team)
- Offshore: Engineering, Support, Ops, Design (70-80% of team)

**Example cost structure** ($3M ARR, 40-person team):

**All-local (Singapore-based)**:
- 40 employees × $6K avg = $240K/month = $2.88M/year
- Gross margin: $3M - $2.88M = $120K (4% margin — UNSUSTAINABLE)

**Hybrid (20% local, 80% offshore)**:
- 8 local (SG) × $8K avg = $64K/month
- 32 offshore (MY/ID/VN) × $2.5K avg = $80K/month
- Total: $144K/month = $1.73M/year
- Gross margin: $3M - $1.73M = $1.27M (42% margin — HEALTHY)

**Savings**: $2.88M - $1.73M = $1.15M/year (40% cost reduction)

---

### Managing Offshore Teams

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Timezone differences (8-12 hour gaps for US/EU teams)
- ❌ Communication overhead (async > real-time, slower feedback loops)
- ❌ Cultural differences (work norms, communication styles)
- ❌ Lower retention (offshore teams churn faster, 20-30% annually)

**Best practices**:

**1. Overlap hours** (schedule 2-4 hour daily overlap):
- Singapore → India: 7:30am-11:30am SGT = 5am-9am IST (4 hour overlap)
- Singapore → Philippines: 8am-5pm SGT = 8am-5pm PHT (full overlap)
- Singapore → Vietnam: 8am-5pm SGT = 7am-4pm VNT (8 hour overlap)

**2. Async-first communication**:
- ✅ Use Slack/Teams for most communication (not Zoom calls)
- ✅ Record key meetings for timezone-shifted teammates
- ✅ Document decisions in Notion/Confluence (not tribal knowledge)

**3. Quarterly offsites**:
- Fly offshore team to HQ once per quarter (3-5 days)
- Team bonding, strategic planning, in-person collaboration
- Cost: $1K-$2K per person per trip (flight + hotel + meals)

**4. Retention strategies**:
- Offer equity (0.01-0.1% for offshore ICs)
- Career growth (offshore → onsite promotion path)
- Competitive comp (pay top 10% of local market, not bottom 50%)

---

## Remote vs Co-located: The 2026 Reality

**The debate**: Should your SEA startup be remote-first or office-first?

### Co-located (Office-First)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Faster communication (tap on shoulder vs Slack delay)
- ✅ Better culture building (team bonding, spontaneous collaboration)
- ✅ Easier onboarding (new hires shadow experienced teammates)
- ✅ Higher productivity for junior employees (learn by osmosis)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Limited talent pool (only hire in 1-2 cities)
- ❌ Higher cost (office rent + local salaries)
- ❌ Commute friction (1-2 hours/day lost to traffic in Jakarta/Manila/Bangkok)

**Best for**:
- Early-stage startups ($0-$2M ARR) building culture
- Sales-heavy companies (need to visit customers)
- Industries requiring high security (fintech, healthcare)

---

### Remote-First

**Pros**:
- ✅ Global talent pool (hire best person anywhere)
- ✅ Cost arbitrage (hire offshore at 30-50% savings)
- ✅ No commute (save 1-2 hours/day per employee)
- ✅ Flexibility (work from anywhere, better work-life balance)

**Cons**:
- ❌ Slower communication (async-first, longer feedback loops)
- ❌ Harder culture building (less spontaneous bonding)
- ❌ Timezone challenges (coordination overhead for global teams)
- ❌ Lower productivity for junior employees (can't learn by osmosis)

**Best for**:
- Tech/SaaS companies with distributed customers
- Cost-conscious startups (maximize gross margin)
- Companies with mature processes (remote works better with clear documentation)

---

### Hybrid (The Winning Strategy for Most SEA Startups)

**The model**:
- Core team (founders, executives, senior ICs): Co-located 3-4 days/week
- Extended team (most ICs): Remote-first with quarterly offsites
- Support/ops team: Fully remote (offshore for cost savings)

**Example setup** ($3M ARR, 40 people):
- 10 core team (SG office 3-4 days/week): Founders, VPs, senior eng/product
- 20 extended team (remote in SEA): Engineers, designers, PMs, marketers
- 10 support team (offshore): Customer support, ops, QA

**Office strategy**:
- Small office (10-15 seats, hot-desking)
- Co-working space (WeWork, JustCo) for flexibility
- Cost: $5K-$10K/month (vs $30K-$50K for dedicated office)

---

## Hiring Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Hiring for "Culture Fit" (Code for "People Like Me")

**The mistake**: "Culture fit" becomes excuse to hire homogenous team (same background, same schools, same race/gender).

**Why it's bad**:
- Homogenous teams have blind spots (miss market opportunities, product insights)
- Groupthink increases (everyone agrees, no one challenges assumptions)
- Legal risk (unconscious bias in hiring leads to discrimination claims)

**Fix**: Hire for "culture add" not "culture fit"
- Ask: "What unique perspective does this person bring?"
- Seek diversity: Different backgrounds, industries, geographies
- Example: Hire enterprise sales rep from corporate to balance startup scrappiness

---

### Mistake 2: Over-Indexing on "Prestigious" Background

**The mistake**: Only hire from top schools (NUS, NTU, Ivy League) or top companies (Google, Meta, McKinsey).

**Why it's bad**:
- Prestigious ≠ high-performing (many top school grads lack hustle)
- Expensive (demand premium salaries due to pedigree)
- Poor culture fit (used to resources/prestige startup can't provide)

**Fix**: Hire for demonstrated performance, not pedigree
- Look for: High agency, fast execution, results-driven (regardless of school/company)
- Example: Mid-tier university grad who built side projects > Stanford grad who coasted

---

### Mistake 3: "Hiring When We Have Time"

**The mistake**: Waiting until you're desperate to hire (someone quit, workload overwhelming).

**Why it's bad**:
- Desperation hiring leads to bad decisions (settle for B-players)
- 3-6 month lag between "we need someone" and "they start" (recruiting takes time)
- Burnout risk (team overworked while waiting for backfill)

**Fix**: Always be recruiting
- Maintain pipeline of 5-10 qualified candidates per role (even if not actively hiring)
- Meet 1-2 candidates per week (coffee chats, informational interviews)
- When you need to hire, you have warm leads (not starting from scratch)

---

### Mistake 4: Hiring Mini-Founders (vs Specialized Talent)

**The mistake**: Every hire must be "founder-quality" (autonomous, visionary, generalist).

**Why it's bad**:
- Unrealistic expectations (most people are specialists, not generalists)
- Expensive (founder-quality people demand founder-level equity)
- Culture clash (too many "chiefs", not enough "Indians")

**Fix**: Hire for the stage you're at
- $0-$1M ARR: Hire generalists (founder-types)
- $1M-$3M ARR: Hire specialists (own a function)
- $3M-$10M ARR: Hire managers (build teams)

---

### Mistake 5: No Onboarding Plan

**The mistake**: New hire shows up Day 1, given laptop, "figure it out".

**Why it's bad**:
- 3-6 months to productivity (vs 1-2 months with proper onboarding)
- Higher turnover (30-40% quit in first year if onboarding is poor)
- Bad first impression (new hire regrets joining)

**Fix**: 30-60-90 day onboarding plan
- **Day 1-7**: Setup (laptop, accounts, meet team)
- **Week 2-4**: Shadow (observe how team works, ask questions)
- **Month 2**: First project (ship something small, get feedback)
- **Month 3**: Full autonomy (own a workstream independently)

**Example onboarding checklist** (Software Engineer):
```
Day 1:
- [ ] Laptop setup (dev environment, Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Meet team (intro call with all teammates)
- [ ] Read codebase README (architecture overview)

Week 1:
- [ ] Ship first commit (fix typo, update docs — something easy)
- [ ] Attend standup (observe team rhythm)
- [ ] 1-on-1 with manager (check-in, answer questions)

Week 2-4:
- [ ] Shadow senior eng (pair program on 2-3 tasks)
- [ ] Review 10 recent PRs (learn code style, patterns)
- [ ] Ship first feature (small bug fix or minor feature)

Month 2:
- [ ] Own first project (ship medium-sized feature end-to-end)
- [ ] Performance check-in (manager feedback: what's going well, what to improve)

Month 3:
- [ ] Full autonomy (own feature area, ship independently)
- [ ] Performance review (formal review, decide if passing probation)
```

## SEA-Specific Hiring Considerations

### Country-by-Country Talent Landscape

#### Singapore

**Characteristics**:
- Expensive (highest salaries in SEA)
- Competitive (talent war with Big Tech, banks, startups)
- Transient (many expats, high churn)

**Salary benchmarks** (2026):
- Senior Engineer: $8K-$12K/month
- Mid-level Engineer: $5K-$8K/month
- Senior Sales: $6K-$10K/month + commission

**What works**:
- ✅ Offer equity (differentiate from corporate jobs)
- ✅ Highlight learning opportunities (startups = career growth)
- ✅ Flexible work (remote options, unlimited PTO)

**What doesn't work**:
- ❌ Below-market salaries (SG talent knows their worth)
- ❌ Long hours pitch (work-life balance matters in SG)
- ❌ Unclear career progression (SG professionals want structure)

---

#### Malaysia

**Characteristics**:
- Affordable (30-40% cheaper than Singapore)
- Bilingual (English + Malay, some Chinese dialects)
- Stable (lower turnover, more loyal)

**Salary benchmarks** (2026):
- Senior Engineer: $3.5K-$5K/month (MYR 15K-22K)
- Mid-level Engineer: $2K-$3.5K/month (MYR 9K-15K)

## Summary

**Key takeaways**:

1. **A-players are 5-10x more productive than B-players** — never settle. Use "Would I want this person as CEO?" test.

2. **Stage-appropriate hiring**: Generalists ($0-$1M) → Specialists ($1M-$3M) → Executives ($3M-$10M).

3. **Navigate the 40-person wall**: Add middle management at 30-40 employees (promote from within preferred).

4. **Equity benchmarks**: First 5 hires get 0.5-2%, hires #6-50 get 0.05-0.5%, VPs get 0.5-2%.

5. **Offshore strategically**: Hire offshore for eng/support/ops (30-50% savings), keep sales/CS/execs local.

6. **Hire executives based on ARR**: VP Sales ($3M), VP Eng ($5M), CFO ($7M), COO ($7M-$10M).

7. **SEA localization**: Adapt hiring approach by country (relationship-first MY/ID/TH, direct SG/VN/PH).
