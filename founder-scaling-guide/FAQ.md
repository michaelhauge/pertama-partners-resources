# Founder Scaling FAQ

## Quick answers to the 30 most common scaling questions

---

### 1. How long does it take to scale from $1M to $10M ARR?

**Short answer**: 18-36 months (median: 24 months) for well-executed startups in SEA.

**Breakdown by starting ARR**:
- $1M → $10M: 24-36 months (slower, building from scratch)
- $3M → $10M: 18-24 months (faster, momentum already exists)
- $5M → $10M: 12-18 months (fastest, doubling from strong base)

**Reality check**:
- **Top 10% (fast scalers)**: 18 months
- **Median (50th percentile)**: 24 months
- **Bottom 25% (slow scalers)**: 36+ months
- **Many never reach $10M**: 70% of $1M ARR startups fail before $10M

**See**: [Operations Guide](guides/01-operations.md) for acceleration tactics.

---

### 2. How much capital do I need to scale from $1M to $10M ARR?

**Short answer**: $3M-$15M total capital (depends on starting ARR, burn rate, growth rate).

**Breakdown**:
- **$1M → $10M ARR**: $10M-$15M (typical Series A $5M-$10M, burn $500K-$1M/month for 24 months)
- **$3M → $10M ARR**: $5M-$10M (typical Series A $5M-$8M, burn $300K-$600K/month for 18 months)
- **$5M → $10M ARR**: $3M-$5M (lean scaling, may not need to raise if profitable)

**Capital efficiency benchmarks** (SEA):
- **Best-in-class**: $0.30-$0.50 raised per $1 ARR (raise $3M-$5M to reach $10M ARR)
- **Good**: $0.50-$1.00 raised per $1 ARR (raise $5M-$10M to reach $10M ARR)
- **Average**: $1.00-$1.50 raised per $1 ARR (raise $10M-$15M to reach $10M ARR)
- **Poor**: >$1.50 raised per $1 ARR (burn too much, hard to justify to investors)

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#how-much-should-i-raise)

---

### 3. What's the right burn rate for my stage?

**Short answer**: 4-6 months of ARR as annual burn (e.g., $3M ARR → burn $500K-$750K/year, or $40K-$60K/month).

**Benchmarks by ARR**:
- **$1M ARR**: Burn $80K-$150K/month (12-18 months runway)
- **$3M ARR**: Burn $200K-$400K/month (12-18 months runway)
- **$5M ARR**: Burn $300K-$600K/month (12-18 months runway)
- **$10M ARR**: Burn $500K-$1M/month (or be profitable)

**Rule of thumb**: Never let runway drop below 12 months (start fundraising at 18 months runway).

**Warning signs**:
- 🚨 Burn >8 months of ARR annually (burning too fast)
- 🚨 Runway <9 months (danger zone — fundraising takes 6-9 months)
- 🚨 Burn growing faster than revenue (inefficient growth)

**See**: [Metrics Dashboard](templates/metrics-dashboards.md#burn-rate-calculator)

---

### 4. When should I raise my next round (Series A, Series B)?

**Series A timing** (raise when you hit these milestones):
- ✅ $2M-$3M ARR (minimum threshold for most Series A investors)
- ✅ 15-25% MoM growth (sustained for 6+ months)
- ✅ <5% monthly churn (product-market fit proven)
- ✅ 12-18 months runway left (don't wait until <9 months)
- ✅ Unit economics proven (LTV/CAC >3, CAC payback <18 months)

**Series B timing** (raise when you hit these):
- ✅ $10M-$15M ARR (minimum for most Series B investors)
- ✅ 10-15% MoM growth (slower than Series A, but still strong)
- ✅ <3% monthly churn (strong retention)
- ✅ Multi-product or multi-region (expansion story for investors)
- ✅ Proven executive team (CFO, CRO, CTO in place)

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#when-to-raise)

---

### 5. How many employees should I have at each ARR milestone?

**Benchmarks** (SaaS companies):
- **$1M ARR**: 8-15 employees ($60K-$125K revenue per employee)
- **$3M ARR**: 20-35 employees ($85K-$150K revenue per employee)
- **$5M ARR**: 30-50 employees ($100K-$165K revenue per employee)
- **$10M ARR**: 50-80 employees ($125K-$200K revenue per employee)

**Rule of thumb**: Target $150K-$200K revenue per employee (efficient scaling).

**Warning signs**:
- 🚨 <$100K revenue per employee (overhired, burning too much)
- 🚨 >$300K revenue per employee (understaffed, growth constrained)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#team-size-by-arr)

---

### 6. What's the "40-person wall" and how do I avoid it?

**The problem**: Most startups hit chaos at 40-60 employees (operations break, culture dilutes, decision-making slows).

**Why it happens**:
- **Informal communication breaks**: At <30 people, everyone knows everything. At 40+, information silos form.
- **Flat hierarchy fails**: No middle management (everyone reports to founder) becomes unmanageable.
- **Process gaps emerge**: Manual processes that worked for 10 customers break at 100 customers.

**How to avoid**:
1. **Implement middle management** (hire managers at 30-40 employees, before chaos hits)
2. **Formalize communication** (weekly all-hands, written updates, Slack channels by function)
3. **Automate processes** (eliminate 60-80% of manual work before scaling past 40 people)
4. **Define values & culture** (codify culture before dilution occurs)

**See**: [Operations Guide](guides/01-operations.md#navigating-the-40-person-wall)

---

### 7. Should I hire a COO, and when?

**When to hire COO**: At $3M-$5M ARR (or 30-50 employees), when founder is overwhelmed with operations.

**Signs you need a COO**:
- ✅ Founder spending >50% of time on internal ops (not customer-facing or product)
- ✅ Operations breaking (processes manual, teams misaligned, execution slowing)
- ✅ Fundraising or product requires founder's attention (need someone to run the business)

**COO responsibilities**:
- Own day-to-day operations (sales, customer success, support, ops)
- Implement processes and systems (automation, metrics, cadences)
- Manage department heads (VP Sales, VP CS, VP Ops)
- Free up founder for fundraising, product, strategy

**Cost**: $150K-$250K base salary + 0.5-2% equity (SEA market rates)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#when-to-hire-coo)

---

### 8. How much equity should I give early hires (first 10-20 employees)?

**Equity ranges** (SEA market rates):

**C-suite**:
- **CTO** (first technical leader): 2-5%
- **COO** (first ops leader): 1-3%
- **CFO** (first finance leader): 0.5-2%
- **VP Sales/Marketing/Eng**: 0.5-1.5%

**Early employees** (first 10 hires):
- **Employee #1-5**: 0.5-1.5%
- **Employee #6-10**: 0.2-0.8%
- **Employee #11-20**: 0.1-0.5%

**Rule of thumb**: Use [Slicing Pie](https://slicingpie.com/) or [Angel.co equity calculator](https://angel.co/salary) for market benchmarks.

**Vesting**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (standard)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#equity-compensation-guide)

---

### 9. When should I transition from MVP code to scalable architecture?

**Timing**: At $2M-$5M ARR (or when you hit these pain points):

**Pain points that trigger rebuild**:
- ✅ Shipping velocity drops 50-70% (tech debt slowing feature development)
- ✅ Bugs increase 3-5x (brittle codebase, regressions frequent)
- ✅ Downtime >1 hour/month (infrastructure can't handle load)
- ✅ Customer complaints spike (performance, reliability issues)
- ✅ Engineers complain daily (morale drops, turnover risk)

**Rebuild approach**:
- **Full rewrite**: 6-12 months, $500K-$2M (risky, but sometimes necessary)
- **Incremental refactor**: 12-24 months, $200K-$1M (safer, but slower)
- **Hybrid**: Rewrite core + refactor periphery (6-18 months, $300K-$1.5M)

**See**: [Tech Stack Guide](guides/03-tech-stack.md#when-to-rebuild)

---

### 10. What are the must-track metrics for $1M-$10M ARR startups?

**The Essential 20 Metrics**:

**Revenue Metrics**:
1. ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
2. MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
3. New MRR (from new customers)
4. Expansion MRR (from existing customers)
5. Churned MRR (from lost customers)

**Growth Metrics**:
6. MoM growth rate (% growth month-over-month)
7. QoQ growth rate (% growth quarter-over-quarter)
8. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) — target: >100%

**Customer Metrics**:
9. Customer count (total active customers)
10. Average Contract Value (ACV)
11. Monthly churn rate — target: <3%
12. Logo churn (customer count lost)

**Sales & Marketing Metrics**:
13. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
14. LTV (Lifetime Value) — target: LTV/CAC >3
15. CAC Payback Period — target: <18 months
16. Sales cycle length (days from lead → closed-won)

**Financial Metrics**:
17. Gross margin — target: 70-80% for SaaS
18. Burn rate (monthly cash burn)
19. Runway (months of cash remaining)
20. Cash balance

**See**: [Metrics Dashboard Template](templates/metrics-dashboards.md)

---

### 11. How do I know if I'm hiring A-players vs B-players?

**A-player vs B-player comparison**:

| Trait | A-Player | B-Player | C-Player |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Execution** | Consistently exceeds goals (120%+ of quota) | Meets goals (90-110% of quota) | Misses goals (<90%) |
| **Autonomy** | Self-directed, needs minimal oversight | Needs some guidance | Requires constant management |
| **Velocity** | Ships fast, iterates quickly | Steady pace | Slow, gets stuck |
| **Problem-solving** | Identifies & solves problems proactively | Solves assigned problems | Escalates everything |
| **Team impact** | Raises team performance (others learn from them) | Neutral impact | Drags team down |
| **Culture fit** | Embraces values, models behavior | Fits culture adequately | Toxic or misaligned |

**Hiring signals for A-players**:
- ✅ Track record of exceeding goals (ask: "What were your targets? What did you achieve?")
- ✅ Self-aware (knows strengths + weaknesses, asks for feedback)
- ✅ Specific examples (uses "I" not "we", describes exact actions taken)
- ✅ Learning orientation (asks questions about role, company, challenges)

**See**: [Hiring Scorecard Template](templates/hiring-scorecards.md)

---

### 12. Should I allow remote work, or require co-located teams?

**Short answer**: Hybrid is optimal (co-located core team + remote for specific roles).

**Co-located roles** (better in-office):
- **Product & Engineering** (high collaboration, rapid iteration benefits from in-person)
- **Leadership team** (exec alignment requires in-person time)
- **Early-stage roles** (first 5-10 hires need close mentorship)

**Remote-friendly roles** (can be remote):
- **Sales** (field reps, account executives in different markets)
- **Customer Success** (distributed customers = distributed CS team)
- **Support** (follow-the-sun support across time zones)
- **Marketing** (content, growth, performance marketing)

**Hybrid model** (recommended):
- Core team (product, eng, leadership) in office 3-4 days/week
- Remote team (sales, CS, support) distributed across SEA
- Quarterly offsites (bring remote team together for 2-3 days)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#remote-vs-co-located)

---

### 13. Which SEA market should I expand to first (after Singapore)?

**Market selection framework**:

**Expand to Malaysia first** (if your ICP is B2B SaaS, fintech, or enterprise):
- **Why**: Closest culturally, English widely spoken, 33M people (vs SG 5.6M)
- **Go-to-market**: Direct sales (similar to SG), premium pricing (25-40% lower than SG)
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months to establish presence (hire country manager + 3-5 sales reps)

**Expand to Indonesia first** (if your ICP is consumer, e-commerce, or SMB):
- **Why**: Largest market (275M people = 40% of SEA), massive upside if you crack it
- **Go-to-market**: Partnerships + local teams (direct sales too expensive initially)
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months to establish presence (complex market, relationship-driven)

**Expand to Thailand/Vietnam** (if MY/ID don't fit your ICP):
- **Thailand**: 70M people, relationship-driven, good for hospitality/tourism SaaS
- **Vietnam**: 98M people, fast-growing, good for developer tools/tech infrastructure

**See**: [Regional Expansion Guide](guides/05-expansion.md#market-selection-framework)

---

### 14. How much should I spend on sales & marketing at each ARR stage?

**Benchmarks** (as % of ARR):

**Early-stage** ($1M-$3M ARR):
- **Sales**: 30-50% of ARR (building sales team, high CAC initially)
- **Marketing**: 10-20% of ARR (content, inbound, events)
- **Total S&M**: 40-70% of ARR

**Growth-stage** ($3M-$10M ARR):
- **Sales**: 40-60% of ARR (scaling sales team, CAC remains high)
- **Marketing**: 15-25% of ARR (scale content, paid, partnerships)
- **Total S&M**: 55-85% of ARR

**At-scale** (>$10M ARR):
- **Sales**: 30-40% of ARR (sales efficiency improves)
- **Marketing**: 10-20% of ARR (brand + demand gen mature)
- **Total S&M**: 40-60% of ARR

**Rule of thumb**: CAC Payback Period <18 months (recover acquisition cost within 18 months).

**See**: [Metrics Dashboard](templates/metrics-dashboards.md#cac-payback-calculator)

---

### 15. What's the biggest mistake founders make when scaling?

**Mistake #1: Premature hiring (hiring too fast before product-market fit)**

**Problem**: Hire 20-30 people at $1M ARR, burn $300K-$500K/month, run out of cash before finding PMF.

**Fix**: Stay lean until $2M-$3M ARR (proof of repeatable sales motion). Don't hire sales reps until sales process is repeatable.

**Other common mistakes**:
- **Not firing fast enough**: Keep C-players too long (drag team down, cost $100K-$300K/year in opportunity cost)
- **Ignoring tech debt**: Let MVP code rot until it collapses (6-12 month rebuild costs $500K-$2M)
- **Over-expanding regionally**: Try to enter 6 SEA countries simultaneously (burn $2M-$5M, fail in all)
- **Raising at wrong time**: Raise too early (bad terms) or too late (desperate, accept bad terms)

**See**: [Operations Guide](guides/01-operations.md#common-scaling-mistakes)

---

### 16. How do I structure my leadership team ($3M-$10M ARR)?

**Core leadership team** ($3M-$10M ARR):

**CEO** (Founder):
- Strategy, fundraising, product vision, board management

**COO** (hire at $3M-$5M ARR):
- Day-to-day operations, sales, CS, support, ops

**CTO** (hire at $1M-$3M ARR, or co-founder):
- Product development, engineering, infrastructure, security

**CFO** (hire at $5M-$10M ARR):
- Finance, FP&A, fundraising support, board reporting

**CRO/VP Sales** (hire at $2M-$3M ARR):
- Sales team, pipeline, revenue targets

**VP Marketing** (hire at $3M-$5M ARR):
- Demand gen, content, brand, events

**VP Engineering** (hire at $3M-$5M ARR if CTO becomes more strategic):
- Engineering team, technical execution, hiring engineers

**VP Customer Success** (hire at $3M-$5M ARR):
- CS team, retention, expansion, customer health

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#leadership-team-structure)

---

### 17. Should I bootstrap or raise venture capital?

**Bootstrap if**:
- ✅ You can reach profitability at $3M-$5M ARR (don't need external capital)
- ✅ You want to maintain control (100% ownership, no board interference)
- ✅ You're comfortable with slower growth (10-20% MoM vs 20-30% with VC)

**Raise VC if**:
- ✅ Market opportunity requires speed (winner-take-most dynamics, need to move fast)
- ✅ You're comfortable with dilution (20-40% equity given up over Series A-C)
- ✅ You want to scale faster (30-50% MoM growth with capital)

**Hybrid approach** (recommended for many SEA startups):
- Bootstrap to $1M-$2M ARR (prove PMF, raise at better valuation)
- Raise Series A at $2M-$3M ARR (fuel growth, hire aggressively)
- Consider Series B at $10M+ ARR (regional expansion, acquisitions)

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#bootstrap-vs-raise)

---

### 18. How do I pitch to US vs SEA vs China investors?

**US investors** (Sequoia, Lightspeed, a16z):
- **What they want**: Huge TAM ($1B+), 20-30% MoM growth, 10-20x ARR valuation expectations
- **How to pitch**: Emphasize market size, growth rate, unit economics (CAC/LTV)
- **Pros**: Large checks ($5M-$20M), helpful with US expansion
- **Cons**: Higher growth expectations, may not understand SEA nuances

**SEA investors** (Peak XV India, Alpha JWC, Vertex, Jungle Ventures):
- **What they want**: SEA market knowledge, regional expansion plan, 10-15x ARR valuation
- **How to pitch**: Emphasize regional playbook, localization, SEA-specific challenges
- **Pros**: Understand SEA dynamics, helpful with regional expansion
- **Cons**: Smaller checks ($2M-$10M), may lack US network

**China investors** (Tencent, Alibaba, Hillhouse):
- **What they want**: China-to-SEA expansion playbook, tech transfer, 8-12x ARR valuation
- **How to pitch**: Emphasize how you'll leverage China tech/capital for SEA dominance
- **Pros**: Large checks ($10M-$50M), strategic resources (tech, partnerships)
- **Cons**: Strategic agenda (may push you in directions that serve their interests)

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#investor-selection)

---

### 19. What valuation should I expect at Series A in SEA?

**Series A valuation benchmarks** (SEA):

**By ARR**:
- **$2M ARR**: $20M-$40M valuation (10-20x ARR)
- **$3M ARR**: $30M-$60M valuation (10-20x ARR)
- **$5M ARR**: $50M-$100M valuation (10-20x ARR)

**By growth rate** (adjust multiple):
- **30-50% MoM growth**: 15-25x ARR (premium valuation)
- **20-30% MoM growth**: 10-15x ARR (market rate)
- **10-20% MoM growth**: 8-12x ARR (below-market)

**By investor type**:
- **US VCs**: 15-25x ARR (willing to pay premium for fast growth)
- **SEA VCs**: 10-15x ARR (more conservative)
- **China VCs**: 8-12x ARR (focus on strategic value, not pure multiple)

**Reality check**: SEA valuations are 30-50% lower than US (adjust expectations).

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#valuation-frameworks)

---

### 20. How long does fundraising take in SEA?

**Timeline**: 6-9 months (from first pitch to closed round)

**Breakdown**:
- **Month 1-2**: Build investor list, warm intros, initial pitches (30-50 investors)
- **Month 3-4**: Partner meetings, due diligence (5-10 investors move forward)
- **Month 5-6**: Term sheets received (2-3 investors)
- **Month 7-8**: Negotiate terms, finalize lead investor
- **Month 9**: Legal docs, wire transfer, close round

**Faster if** (4-6 months):
- ✅ You have strong intros (not cold outreach)
- ✅ Metrics are exceptional (30%+ MoM growth, <3% churn)
- ✅ Multiple VCs competing (creates urgency)

**Slower if** (9-12 months):
- ❌ Cold outreach (no warm intros)
- ❌ Metrics are weak (10-15% growth, >5% churn)
- ❌ Fundraising during down market (VCs become more cautious)

**See**: [Fundraising Guide](guides/04-fundraising.md#fundraising-timeline)

---

### 21. Should I hire locally or offshore for cost arbitrage?

**Hire locally** (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand):
- ✅ **Product & Engineering leaders** (require close collaboration with founder)
- ✅ **Sales & Customer Success** (need to understand local market, customers)
- ✅ **Early hires** (first 10-20 employees need high touch)

**Hire offshore** (Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines for cost arbitrage):
- ✅ **Engineering execution team** (after product direction is set)
- ✅ **Customer support** (follow-the-sun support across time zones)
- ✅ **Operations/admin** (finance, HR, IT support)

**Cost savings**:
- **Singapore → Malaysia**: Save 40-50% on salaries (engineer: $150K → $80K)
- **Singapore → Indonesia**: Save 60-70% on salaries (engineer: $150K → $50K)
- **Singapore → Vietnam**: Save 60-70% on salaries (engineer: $150K → $45K)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Quality**: Offshore talent can be excellent, but requires more vetting
- **Management**: Remote teams require more structure (clear processes, documentation)
- **Culture**: Harder to maintain culture across distributed teams

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#local-vs-offshore-hiring)

---

### 22. What's the best way to structure equity for employees in SEA?

**Equity pool**: Reserve 10-20% of cap table for employee equity (post-money SAFE or priced round).

**Allocation by role**:
- **C-suite**: 0.5-5% (CTO highest, CFO lowest)
- **VPs**: 0.3-1.5%
- **Managers**: 0.1-0.5%
- **Individual contributors**: 0.01-0.2%

**Vesting schedule**:
- **Standard**: 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
- **Accelerated vesting**: Single-trigger (on acquisition) or double-trigger (acquisition + termination)

**Equity types**:
- **Pre-Series A**: Stock options (ISOs if US entity, NSOs if local)
- **Post-Series A**: RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) — easier to value, less tax complexity

**SEA-specific considerations**:
- **Singapore**: Stock options are tax-efficient (no tax at grant, only at sale)
- **Malaysia**: Stock options taxed at grant (consider phantom equity or cash bonuses instead)
- **Indonesia**: Stock options rare (most companies use cash bonuses)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#equity-compensation-structure)

---

### 23. How do I automate manual processes at scale?

**The 3-step automation framework**:

**Step 1: Map all manual processes** (Week 1-2)
- List every recurring task (sales follow-up, onboarding, reporting, support tickets, etc.)
- Estimate time spent per week (>4 hours/week = automation candidate)
- Prioritize by ROI (time saved ÷ automation cost)

**Step 2: Automate top 3 bottlenecks** (Month 1-2)
- **Tools**: Zapier, Make, n8n (no-code automation)
- **Approach**: Start simple (automate 80% with no-code, hire dev for remaining 20%)
- **Result**: 20-40 hours/week saved across team

**Step 3: Scale automation** (Month 3-6)
- Automate next 5-10 processes (reporting, invoicing, customer alerts)
- Build custom tools (internal dashboards, admin panels)
- **Result**: 60-80% of manual work eliminated

**See**: [Process Automation Playbook](templates/automation-playbooks.md)

---

### 24. When should I hire my first CFO?

**Timing**: At $5M-$10M ARR (or 6-12 months before Series B fundraising).

**Signs you need a CFO**:
- ✅ Preparing for Series B (CFO helps with fundraising, due diligence, investor relations)
- ✅ Revenue >$5M ARR (financial complexity justifies full-time CFO)
- ✅ Founder spending >20% of time on finance (modeling, reporting, fundraising prep)

**CFO responsibilities**:
- Financial planning & analysis (FP&A, budgeting, forecasting)
- Fundraising support (data rooms, investor meetings, term sheet negotiation)
- Board reporting (monthly/quarterly board decks, KPI tracking)
- Finance operations (accounting, payroll, tax, compliance)

**Cost**: $150K-$250K base salary + 0.5-1.5% equity (SEA market rates)

**Alternatives** (if not ready for full-time CFO):
- **Fractional CFO**: $5K-$15K/month (part-time, 10-20 hours/week)
- **Controller**: $80K-$120K (handles accounting, not FP&A or fundraising)

**See**: [Hiring Guide](guides/02-hiring.md#when-to-hire-cfo)

---

### 25. How do I maintain culture as I scale from 10 → 50 → 100 employees?

**The culture dilution problem**: At 10 people, culture is organic (everyone knows everyone). At 50+, culture dilutes (new hires don't absorb values).

**Fix: Codify culture early** ($1M-$3M ARR, before scaling)

**Step 1: Define 5-7 core values** (what behaviors do you reward?)
- Example: "Customer-first", "Move fast", "Ownership", "Transparency", "Learn & iterate"

**Step 2: Operationalize values** (embed in processes)
- **Hiring**: Add values to interview scorecard ("Does candidate embody 'Move fast'?")
- **Performance reviews**: Evaluate against values (not just KPIs)
- **Recognition**: Publicly recognize employees who exemplify values (Slack shoutouts, all-hands mentions)

**Step 3: Reinforce through rituals** (make culture tangible)
- **Weekly all-hands**: Share wins, customer stories, reinforce values
- **Quarterly offsites**: Bring distributed team together, team-building activities
- **Written artifacts**: Culture deck (à la Netflix), onboarding guide, team handbook

**See**: [Operations Guide](guides/01-operations.md#maintaining-culture-at-scale)

---

### 26. What tech stack should I use at $1M vs $10M ARR?

**The $1M tech stack** (MVP tools):
- **CRM**: HubSpot Starter or Pipedrive ($50-$100/user/month)
- **Customer Support**: Intercom or Front ($50-$100/user/month)
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel or Amplitude ($1K-$5K/month)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS or GCP ($5K-$20K/month)
- **Total**: $10K-$30K/month

**The $10M tech stack** (enterprise tools):
- **CRM**: Salesforce Enterprise ($150-$250/user/month)
- **Customer Support**: Zendesk or Intercom ($100-$200/user/month)
- **Analytics**: Amplitude Enterprise or Snowflake ($20K-$50K/month)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS or GCP with dedicated support ($50K-$150K/month)
- **Data warehouse**: Snowflake or BigQuery ($10K-$30K/month)
- **Observability**: Datadog or New Relic ($10K-$30K/month)
- **Security**: SOC 2, SIEM, vulnerability scanning ($20K-$50K/month)
- **Total**: $100K-$300K/month

**Migration timing**: Transition at $3M-$5M ARR (before $10M tools become mandatory).

**See**: [Tech Stack Guide](guides/03-tech-stack.md#tech-stack-by-arr-stage)

---

### 27. How do I know when to fire someone?

**Fire if** (C-player indicators):
- ❌ Consistently misses goals (below 80% of quota for 2+ quarters)
- ❌ Negative team impact (others avoid working with them, morale drops)
- ❌ Requires constant management (can't self-direct, escalates everything)
- ❌ Not learning/improving (same mistakes repeatedly, no growth)
- ❌ Cultural misfit (doesn't embrace values, toxic behavior)

**Performance improvement plan** (PIP):
- Give 30-60 days to improve (clear goals, weekly check-ins)
- Document everything (missed targets, feedback given, support provided)
- If no improvement after 60 days: Terminate

**Severance** (SEA market norms):
- **Singapore**: 1 month notice + 1-3 months severance (depending on tenure)
- **Malaysia**: 1-3 months notice (statutory requirement)
- **Indonesia**: Severance legally required (2-9 months depending on tenure)

**Cost of keeping C-player**: $100K-$300K/year (salary + opportunity cost + team drag).

### 28. What metrics should I track daily vs weekly vs monthly?

**Daily** (operational metrics):
- MRR (today's recurring revenue)
- New signups (today's new customers)
- Churn events (customers canceled today)
- Support ticket volume (tickets opened today)

**Weekly** (tactical metrics):
- New MRR (this week vs last week)
- Churn rate (this week's churn % vs last week)
- Sales pipeline ($X in pipeline, Y deals, Z conversion rate)
- Customer health scores (% red/yellow/green accounts)

**Monthly** (strategic metrics):
- ARR growth (% growth month-over-month)
- Churn rate (% monthly churn)
- CAC / LTV / CAC Payback Period
- Gross margin
- Burn rate / runway

**Quarterly** (board-level metrics):
- QoQ growth rate
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Rule of 40 (growth rate + profit margin)
- Employee count / revenue per employee

**See**: [Metrics Dashboard Template](templates/metrics-dashboards.md)

### 29. Should I prioritize profitability or growth?

**Short answer**: Depends on your ARR stage and funding environment.

**Prioritize growth** (burn to grow fast):
- **At $1M-$5M ARR**: Focus on growth (30-50% MoM), burn is acceptable if CAC payback <18 months
- **If fundraising**: Growth rate matters more than profitability (investors want 30%+ MoM growth)
- **Winner-take-most markets**: Speed matters (e.g., marketplace, network effects)

**Prioritize profitability** (efficient growth):
- **At $10M+ ARR**: Growth slows naturally (15-25% MoM), focus on unit economics
- **If bootstrapped**: Cash flow positive at $3M-$5M ARR (don't rely on external capital)
- **Down markets**: VCs cautious, profitability = leverage (don't need to raise)

**The "Rule of 40"**: Growth rate + profit margin should be >40%.
- Example: 30% growth + 15% profit = 45% (good)
- Example: 50% growth - 20% loss = 30% (below threshold, burning too much for growth)

### 30. Where do I start if I'm at $2M ARR and feeling overwhelmed?

**Start here**: [90-Day Scaling Sprint](README.md#quick-start-the-90-day-scaling-sprint)

**Priority order** ($2M ARR):
1. **Month 1**: Operations audit → automate top 3 bottlenecks (save 20-40 hours/week)
2. **Month 2**: Set up metrics dashboard → identify gaps (what metrics are red/yellow?)
3. **Month 3**: Plan next 12 months (hiring, tech stack, fundraising)

**Key hires at $2M ARR**:
- **VP Sales** (or Sales Manager) — scale sales team from 2-3 reps → 5-10 reps
- **VP Engineering** (or Lead Engineer) — manage engineering team, reduce tech debt
- **Customer Success Manager** — own retention, reduce churn from 5-8% → 3-5%

**Fundraising timeline** ($2M ARR):
- Start fundraising now (6-9 month process)
- Target: Raise $3M-$8M Series A at $20M-$40M valuation (10-20x ARR)
- Use capital to hire aggressively (10-20 employees over 12 months)

**Expected outcome**: Reach $5M ARR in 12-18 months + strong team + scalable ops.
