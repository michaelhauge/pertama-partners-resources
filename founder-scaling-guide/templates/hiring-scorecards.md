# Template: Hiring Scorecards — A-Player vs B-Player Evaluation Framework

**Purpose**: This template provides objective evaluation criteria for hiring decisions across all roles, helping you consistently identify A-players and avoid B-player hiring mistakes.

**How to use**:
1. Select appropriate scorecard for role (IC, Manager, Executive)
2. Have 2-3 interviewers complete scorecard independently
3. Compare scores (average >3.5/5 = strong hire, <3.0 = pass)
4. Discuss discrepancies (why did one interviewer score 5 and another score 2?)
5. Make decision (hire only if consensus >3.5/5)

## Red Flags (Automatic Pass)

Even if score is high, pass if ANY of these:

**Integrity issues**:
- [ ] Lied on resume (inflated titles, companies, dates)
- [ ] Bad references (when you call previous managers)
- [ ] Plagiarized take-home (copied from GitHub, ChatGPT without attribution)

**Cultural red flags**:
- [ ] Trash-talks previous employer (unprofessional)
- [ ] Arrogant (talks down to interviewers)
- [ ] Only cares about comp/title (no interest in mission)

**Capability red flags**:
- [ ] Can't explain their own work (didn't actually do the work on their resume)
- [ ] Can't answer basic questions in their domain (engineer can't write FizzBuzz)
- [ ] No examples (can't give concrete stories, everything is vague)

---

## Interview Calibration

**Goal**: Ensure interviewers score consistently (not one harsh grader, one easy grader)

**Process**:
1. After first 5 candidates, compare scores across interviewers
2. Identify discrepancies (one interviewer averages 4.5/5, another averages 2.5/5)
3. Calibrate (discuss why scores differ, align on what 5/5 vs 3/5 looks like)
4. Re-score outliers

## Summary

**Key principles**:

1. **Objective evaluation**: Use scorecard (not gut feeling) to reduce bias

2. **Multiple interviewers**: 2-3 people complete scorecard independently (consensus-based decision)

3. **High bar**: Only hire if >35/50 (ICs/Managers), >38/50 (Executives)

4. **Red flags = automatic pass**: Even if score is high, pass if integrity/culture/capability issues

5. **Calibrate regularly**: Ensure interviewers score consistently (not too harsh or too easy)

**Common hiring mistakes to avoid**:
- Hiring based on pedigree (Stanford grad ≠ A-player)
- Settling for B-players (desperation hiring)
- Gut-feeling hiring (no objective criteria)
- Solo decision (founder makes all hiring decisions without team input)

**Next steps**:
- Copy scorecard template to Google Sheets
- Train interviewers on how to use scorecard (30-60 min session)
- Start using scorecard for next 5 candidates
- Calibrate after first 5 (compare scores, align on standards)
- Review Part 2: Hiring & Team Building for full hiring strategy
