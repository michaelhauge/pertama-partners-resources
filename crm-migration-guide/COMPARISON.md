## Feature Gap Analysis

### Features You'll GAIN by Switching

From **HubSpot Starter** → Zoho/Freshsales/Pipedrive:
- ✅ Unlimited custom fields (HubSpot Starter limits these)
- ✅ Better workflow automation
- ✅ Native WhatsApp integration (Zoho)
- ✅ Lower cost per user
- ✅ Better mobile app offline mode

From **Salesforce Essentials** → Zoho/Freshsales/Pipedrive:
- ✅ Simpler, more intuitive interface
- ✅ Native WhatsApp (Zoho)
- ✅ Better onboarding/setup experience
- ✅ More responsive customer support

---

### Features You'll LOSE by Switching

From **HubSpot Pro/Enterprise**:
- ❌ Marketing Hub integration (if you use it heavily)
- ❌ HubSpot Academy certifications
- ❌ Advanced predictive lead scoring
- ❌ Large marketplace of third-party integrations

**Mitigation**: Use n8n for custom integrations. Use dedicated marketing tools (Mailchimp, SendGrid) separately.

From **Salesforce Pro/Enterprise**:
