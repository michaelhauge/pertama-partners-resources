## Red Flags: When NOT to Migrate

### 🚩 You heavily use HubSpot Marketing Hub

**Problem**: HubSpot's strength is marketing automation. CRM is just part of the platform.

**Solution**:
- Option A: Keep HubSpot (it's worth the cost for marketing)
- Option B: Separate marketing + CRM (e.g., Mailchimp + Zoho CRM)

**Decision rule**: If >50% of your HubSpot value is marketing automation, don't migrate.

---

### 🚩 You have custom Salesforce Apex code

**Problem**: Apex code is Salesforce-specific and won't work in other CRMs.

**Solution**:
- Option A: Rewrite customizations in new CRM (if simple logic)
- Option B: Stay with Salesforce (if complex customizations)

**Decision rule**: If you have >10 Apex classes or complex Lightning components, migration risk is high.

---

### 🚩 You use 10+ AppExchange apps

**Problem**: AppExchange is Salesforce-only. You'll lose these integrations.

**Solution**:
- Find equivalent integrations in new CRM marketplace
- Use n8n/Zapier to rebuild custom integrations

**Decision rule**: If AppExchange apps are mission-critical and no alternatives exist, stay with Salesforce.

---

### 🚩 Your team is already happy with current CRM

**Problem**: Change management is hard. Unhappy team = productivity loss.

**Solution**:
- Test new CRM with 2-3 power users first
- Get team buy-in before migrating
- Provide training and support

**Decision rule**: If team strongly resists change, savings may not be worth the hassle.

---

### 🚩 You're an enterprise with 100+ CRM users

**Problem**: At this scale, Salesforce is price-competitive and you likely have custom integrations.

**Solution**: Negotiate better Salesforce pricing instead of migrating.

**Decision rule**: For 100+ users, migration is only worth it if you'll save $2,000+/month.
