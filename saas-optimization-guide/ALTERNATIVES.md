## Decision Framework: When to Switch

### Always Switch If:
- [ ] Current tool has zero usage (no logins in 90 days)
- [ ] Free alternative exists with 90%+ feature parity
- [ ] Savings >$500/month and migration takes <1 day
- [ ] Tool is complete duplicate (have 2 of the exact same thing)

### Usually Switch If:
- [ ] Savings >$200/month
- [ ] Migration difficulty = Easy
- [ ] Alternative has 80%+ feature parity
- [ ] Current tool renewal coming up soon

### Negotiate Instead If:
- [ ] Savings <$100/month (not worth migration effort)
- [ ] Migration difficulty = Hard
- [ ] Team heavily relies on current tool
- [ ] Switching would disrupt critical workflows

### Keep Current Tool If:
- [ ] Unique features critical to business
- [ ] High switching costs (data migration complexity)
- [ ] Team extremely resistant to change
- [ ] Already on best-value option for your needs

## Migration Priorities

**Prioritize switching** (highest ROI first):

1. **Unused tools** (Score 0-2) - Cancel immediately, zero migration effort
2. **Free alternatives** - 100% savings, usually easy migration
3. **Expensive duplicates** - High savings, medium effort
4. **All-in-one consolidation** - Very high savings, higher effort but worth it

**Delay switching** (lower ROI):

1. **Cheap tools** (<$50/month) - Savings too small to prioritize
2. **Mission-critical tools** - High risk if migration fails
3. **Hard migrations** - Save for dedicated project time
4. **Happy teams** - If team loves current tool, negotiate instead

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review your inventory** from [01-inventory.md](./guides/01-inventory.md)
2. **Find your tools** in the tables above
3. **Calculate potential savings** (Current cost - Alternative cost) × # users
4. **Prioritize by ROI** (Savings / Migration difficulty)
5. **Execute top 5-10** consolidations
6. **Track results** - Document actual savings achieved

**Expected outcome**: $500-3,000/month in tool consolidation savings.
