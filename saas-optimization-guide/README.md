## The Problem

The average small-to-medium business uses **50-100+ SaaS tools** and spends **$500-5,000/month** on software subscriptions.

**30-40% of this spend is waste**:
- ❌ Unused licenses (employees left, features never used)
- ❌ Duplicate tools (3 project management tools, 2 CRMs)
- ❌ Overbuilt plans (Enterprise when Starter would suffice)
- ❌ Missing volume discounts (never asked for better pricing)
- ❌ Auto-renewals at full price (no negotiation)

**Example company** (50 employees, $3,500/month SaaS spend):
- Savings potential: $1,050-1,400/month
- Annual savings: **$12,600-16,800**
- 3-year savings: **$37,800-50,400**

> *These savings estimates are based on common patterns we see in SaaS audits: unused licenses, duplicate tools, and unoptimized plans. Your actual savings depend on your current stack complexity and spending. Companies with tighter existing controls will see lower savings; those who have never audited may find even more.*

---

## The Solution

This guide provides a **4-step audit process** to:

1. **Discover** - Build complete SaaS inventory
2. **Analyze** - Identify waste and redundancy
3. **Optimize** - Consolidate, negotiate, cancel
4. **Govern** - Prevent future SaaS sprawl

**Time required**: 2-4 weeks for full audit (8-16 hours of work)
**Typical savings**: 30-50% of current SaaS spend
**ROI**: 10-20x (pay back audit time in first quarter)

---

## Quick Self-Assessment

**Do you have SaaS sprawl?** Check if any of these apply:

- [ ] You can't list all the SaaS tools your company uses from memory
- [ ] You've discovered subscriptions still active for employees who left 6+ months ago
- [ ] You have 2+ tools in the same category (e.g., Asana + Monday + ClickUp)
- [ ] You're on "Enterprise" plans but use <20% of advanced features
- [ ] You haven't negotiated pricing in the last 12 months
- [ ] You renew annually without checking competitors
- [ ] You don't track which users actually log into each tool
- [ ] Your finance team doesn't have visibility into all software spend

**If you checked 3+**, you likely have 25-40% savings opportunity.
**If you checked 5+**, you likely have 40-50%+ savings opportunity.

## Real-World Case Studies

These are composite case studies based on common patterns from SEA SaaS audits. Names and details are anonymized.

### Case Study 1: Singapore Digital Agency (42 Employees)

**Company**: Creative and digital marketing agency, $4.2M revenue, 42 employees across creative, account management, and dev teams.

**The problem**: Monthly SaaS bill was $4,800 and climbing. Finance flagged it as the fastest-growing expense line. No one owned "software spending" — each department bought tools independently.

**What they tried**: Full 4-step audit process over 3 weeks.

**What went wrong**:
- Discovered the creative team was paying for both Adobe Creative Cloud ($54/user × 12 users = $648/mo) AND Canva Teams ($13/user × 15 users = $195/mo) — but only 3 people used both
- When they tried to cancel Canva, the social media team revolted — they preferred Canva for quick social graphics and didn't know Illustrator
- Negotiating with HubSpot for a 20% discount backfired — the account manager offered 10% but locked them into a 2-year contract with a 15% price increase in Year 2
- Migrating from Slack + Asana + Trello to just Slack + Notion took 6 weeks, not 1 week — historical data migration was the bottleneck

**Actual results**:
- Monthly SaaS: $4,800 → $3,100 (35% reduction, $20,400/year saved)
- Tools: 52 → 34 (consolidated project management, canceled 8 unused subscriptions)
- But: Lost 2 weeks of productivity during Notion migration, and 3 team members still secretly use Trello (old habits)

**Key takeaway**: Cancel unused tools immediately (easy wins), but consolidation is harder — budget 4-6 weeks for any major tool migration, and expect some resistance.

### Case Study 2: Malaysian E-Commerce Company (28 Employees)

**Company**: Fashion e-commerce, $2.1M revenue, selling primarily in Malaysia and Singapore via Shopify and marketplaces.

**The problem**: Discovered they were paying for 38 SaaS tools, but could only name 20 from memory. Multiple credit cards across departments made tracking impossible.

**What they tried**: Started with the inventory step (Guide 01) — pulling all credit card and bank statements to find every subscription.

**What went wrong**:
- Found 6 "zombie subscriptions" — tools for employees who had left 6-12 months ago ($380/month wasted)
- Shopify Advanced plan ($399/mo) was overkill — they used none of the Advanced features. But downgrading required reconfiguring checkout flow, which took their dev team 3 days
- Tried switching from Mailchimp ($150/mo) to Brevo (free tier) — but their email templates didn't transfer cleanly, and they had to rebuild 15 templates manually
- Finance team initially refused to participate, saying "it's only $3,000/month — not worth the effort"

**Actual results**:
- Monthly SaaS: $3,200 → $1,850 (42% reduction, $16,200/year saved)
- Biggest wins: Zombie subscriptions ($380/mo), Shopify downgrade ($200/mo savings), email platform switch ($120/mo)
- Time invested: 14 hours over 3 weeks
- ROI: $16,200 saved / 14 hours invested = $1,157/hour effective rate

**Key takeaway**: The inventory step alone (finding zombie subscriptions and forgotten tools) typically saves 10-15% — do this even if you skip everything else.

### Case Study 3: Vietnamese SaaS Startup (15 Employees)

**Company**: B2B analytics SaaS, $800K ARR, 15 employees. Lean startup trying to extend runway before Series A.

**The problem**: Runway was 8 months. Needed to cut $2,000/month from burn rate. SaaS spend was $1,900/month — nearly all of it felt "essential."

**What they tried**: Aggressive consolidation — trying to replace paid tools with free alternatives wherever possible.

**What went wrong**:
- Replaced Figma (paid) with free Penpot — designers spent 3x longer on tasks due to missing features. Reversed after 2 weeks.
- Switched from Datadog ($250/mo) to self-hosted Grafana — saved money but spent 20+ engineering hours setting it up. Opportunity cost was worse than the savings.
- Negotiated annual payment on 3 tools for 20% discount — but this consumed $3,600 cash upfront when cash preservation was the priority
- One optimization that worked brilliantly: switched from AWS us-east-1 to ap-southeast-1 — reduced latency for SEA customers AND saved 8% on data transfer

**Actual results**:
- Monthly SaaS: $1,900 → $1,350 (29% reduction, $6,600/year saved)
- Net savings after accounting for failed experiments: $4,800/year
- Extended runway by ~1 month
- But: 2 weeks of engineering time lost on Grafana migration attempt

**Key takeaway**: For startups, optimize for cash preservation AND engineering time. Free alternatives aren't free if they cost 20 hours of engineering.

## Quick Start: 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Discover (Week 1)

**Build your SaaS inventory** - Find every tool your company pays for

**Sources**:
- Finance/accounting records (recurring charges)
- IT department (SSO logins, user provisioning)
- Department surveys (shadow IT tools)
- Credit card statements
- App store subscriptions

**Output**: Complete inventory with tool name, vendor, cost, users, renewal date

**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Guide**: [01-inventory.md](./guides/01-inventory.md)

---

### Step 2: Analyze (Week 2)

**Score each tool** - Identify waste and redundancy

**Analysis dimensions**:
1. **Usage** - How many people actually use this? (SSO login data)
2. **Value** - What business outcome does this enable?
3. **Overlap** - Do we have other tools that do the same thing?
4. **Cost per user** - Is this expensive relative to alternatives?
5. **Required vs nice-to-have** - Would the business break without this?

**Output**: Each tool scored as Keep / Consolidate / Negotiate / Cancel

**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Guide**: [02-usage-analysis.md](./guides/02-usage-analysis.md)

---

### Step 3: Optimize (Week 3)

**Take action** - Consolidate, negotiate, cancel

**Actions by category**:

**Cancel** (Score: 0-3/10):
- Unused tools (zero logins in 90 days)
- Duplicates after consolidation
- Shadow IT not aligned with company tools

**Negotiate** (Score: 6-8/10):
- Critical tools with upcoming renewals
- Tools you've used >2 years (ask for loyalty discount)
- Tools where you're paying list price

**Consolidate** (Score: 4-6/10):
- Multiple tools in same category
- Opportunities to use all-in-one platforms
- Features available in tools you already pay for

**Output**: $X,000/month in savings identified and executed

**Time**: 4-6 hours + ongoing negotiations
**Guides**: [03-consolidation.md](./guides/03-consolidation.md), [04-negotiation.md](./guides/04-negotiation.md)

---

### Step 4: Govern (Ongoing)

**Prevent future sprawl** - Set up approval process

**Governance framework**:
1. **Procurement approval** - All new SaaS requires VP/CFO sign-off
2. **Renewal review** - Quarterly check-in on utilization
3. **Deprovisioning** - Offboard process removes unused licenses
4. **Consolidation first** - Before buying new tool, check if existing tool can do it
5. **Annual audit** - Repeat this process every 12 months

**Output**: SaaS spend stays optimized long-term

**Time**: 1-2 hours setup, then 30 min/quarter maintenance
**Guides**: [05-governance.md](./guides/05-governance.md), [06-annual-review.md](./guides/06-annual-review.md)

---

## Common Tool Categories

Here are the most common categories where we see waste and consolidation opportunities:

### Productivity & Collaboration

**Common tools**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Notion, Airtable, Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Trello

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Notion can replace Asana/Trello/Confluence for many teams
- Google Workspace includes Sheets (can replace Airtable for simple use cases)
- Slack + Google Drive can replace many specialized collaboration tools

**Typical savings**: $500-2,000/month

---

### CRM & Sales

**Common tools**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, Freshsales, Intercom, Drift

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Many teams pay for HubSpot CRM + Marketing + Sales when they only need 1-2 modules
- Live chat (Intercom/Drift) often included in CRM tools at lower cost
- See our [CRM Migration Guide](../crm-migration-guide/) for detailed comparison

**Typical savings**: $300-1,500/month

---

### Marketing & Email

**Common tools**: Mailchimp, HubSpot Marketing, SendGrid, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), ConvertKit

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Brevo offers generous free tier (300 emails/day) vs Mailchimp paid plans
- HubSpot Marketing can replace Mailchimp + landing page tools
- SendGrid more cost-effective for transactional email than Mailchimp

**Typical savings**: $200-800/month

---

### Project Management

**Common tools**: Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Jira, Trello, Basecamp

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Most teams only need ONE project management tool
- Notion can replace project management for non-technical teams
- ClickUp offers more features at lower cost than Asana/Monday

**Typical savings**: $400-1,200/month (if paying for multiple tools)

---

### Design & Creative

**Common tools**: Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma, Canva, Sketch

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Canva Pro ($13/user) replaces 80% of Adobe CC use cases for non-designers
- Figma free tier sufficient for many startups
- Stock photo subscriptions often unused (cancel and use free alternatives)

**Typical savings**: $300-1,500/month

---

### Finance & Accounting

**Common tools**: QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, PayPal, Bill.com, Expensify

**Consolidation opportunities**:
- Stripe billing can replace separate invoicing tools
- Many accounting tools include expense management (don't need separate Expensify)
- Xero typically cheaper than QuickBooks for similar features

**Typical savings**: $100-500/month

---

## Savings Opportunities by Company Size

### 10-25 employees

**Typical SaaS spend**: $800-2,000/month
**Savings potential**: $240-800/month (30-40%)
**Low-hanging fruit**:
- Cancel unused tools (old trial accounts still billing)
- Downgrade overbuilt plans (Enterprise → Professional)
- Free alternatives (Mailchimp → Brevo, Asana → Notion)

---

### 25-50 employees

**Typical SaaS spend**: $2,000-4,000/month
**Savings potential**: $800-1,600/month (40-45%)
**Low-hanging fruit**:
- Consolidate project management (3 tools → 1 tool)
- Negotiate renewals (ask for 15-20% discount)
- All-in-one platforms (Zoho ONE, Google Workspace)

---

### 50-100 employees

**Typical SaaS spend**: $4,000-8,000/month
**Savings potential**: $1,600-3,500/month (40-50%)
**Low-hanging fruit**:
- Volume discounts (renegotiate all major tools)
- Remove unused licenses (employees who left)
- Strategic consolidation (replace 10-15 tools with Zoho ONE)

---

### 100+ employees

**Typical SaaS spend**: $8,000-25,000/month
**Savings potential**: $3,000-10,000/month (30-40%)
**Low-hanging fruit**:
- Enterprise agreements (better per-seat pricing)
- Vendor managed services (free migration help)
- Dedicated account management (custom pricing)

---

## What Goes Wrong and How to Fix It

### "We can't find all our SaaS subscriptions"

**Symptom**: Credit card statements show charges you don't recognize. Different departments use different cards. No central record.

**Likely cause**: Decentralized purchasing — each team lead signed up for tools independently, often on personal or department cards.

**Fix**:
1. Pull 6 months of statements from ALL company credit cards and bank accounts
2. Search email inboxes for "receipt", "subscription", "renewal", and "invoice"
3. Check Google Workspace / Microsoft 365 admin → connected apps (finds OAuth-linked tools)
4. Send a 5-question survey to all team leads: "What tools does your team use daily?"

**Prevention**: Consolidate all SaaS payments to one corporate card. Require finance approval for any new subscription over $50/month.

---

### "Team resists when we try to cancel or consolidate tools"

**Symptom**: You identify a tool for cancellation but the team using it pushes back hard — "We need this!" or "The alternative isn't as good."

**Likely cause**: People are attached to familiar tools. Switching costs are real (learning curve, lost workflows, data migration). Sometimes they're right.

**Fix**:
1. Don't force-cancel tools that are actively used — instead, demonstrate the alternative side-by-side
2. Give the team a 2-week trial of the replacement tool. If it genuinely doesn't work, keep the original.
3. Distinguish between "nice to have" resistance and "this actually breaks my workflow" resistance

**Prevention**: Involve team leads in the audit process from Day 1. People accept changes they help design.

---

### "We saved money but productivity dropped"

**Symptom**: SaaS bill went down 30% but teams are slower, frustrated, or spending time on workarounds.

**Likely cause**: Over-optimized — cut tools that were actually providing value, or consolidated to a tool that doesn't fully replace what was removed.

**Fix**:
1. Track productivity metrics for 30 days after any major tool change (task completion rate, support tickets, team satisfaction)
2. If productivity drops more than 10%, consider reverting that specific change
3. Savings should come from unused/duplicate tools, not from removing tools people actively rely on

**Prevention**: Score each tool on both cost AND usage before cutting. High-usage tools should be renegotiated, not eliminated.

---

### "Vendor won't give us a discount"

**Symptom**: You asked for a discount on renewal and the vendor said no, or offered a trivial 5% reduction.

**Likely cause**: Wrong timing, wrong leverage, or wrong person. Vendors discount most aggressively near their quarter-end, when you have competitive alternatives, or when you're threatening to downgrade.

**Fix**:
1. Time your ask — reach out 60-90 days before renewal, and especially near vendor's quarter-end (March, June, September, December for most)
2. Get a competing quote — "Zoho offered us $X for similar features" creates real leverage
3. Offer a multi-year commitment in exchange for discount (but only if you're sure you'll keep the tool)
4. Ask for value adds instead of price cuts — extra users, premium support, or feature upgrades at same price

**Prevention**: Never auto-renew at list price. Set calendar reminders 90 days before every renewal.

---

## Limitations & When This Doesn't Apply

**SaaS optimization is high-ROI for most companies, but not all situations are the same:**

- **If you're under 10 employees**: You probably have 10-20 SaaS tools total. A formal audit may be overkill — just review your credit card statements monthly.
- **If you just did an audit**: Diminishing returns kick in. The first audit typically finds 30-50% savings. The second finds 5-10%.
- **Enterprise contracts**: Large contracts ($10K+/year) have different negotiation dynamics than small team plans. The negotiation tactics here work best for $500-$5,000/year contracts.
- **Switching costs are real**: Consolidating tools saves money but costs time. Factor in 2-4 weeks of migration and training per major tool change. Don't switch 5 tools at once.
- **Some "waste" is intentional**: Teams sometimes use overlapping tools for good reasons (e.g., Slack AND Teams if clients use different platforms). Not all overlap should be eliminated.
