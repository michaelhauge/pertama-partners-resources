# Step 6: Annual Review Process

**Time required**: 4-6 hours per year
**When**: Same month annually (recommended: January)
**Output**: Refreshed inventory, renewed savings, updated policies

---

## Why Annual Reviews?

**The problem**: SaaS sprawl creeps back over 12 months

**What happens without annual review**:
- New tools added without consolidation checks
- Renewals happen on auto-pilot at list price
- Usage declines but licenses stay the same
- Departed employees' licenses not removed
- SaaS spend increases 15-25% year-over-year

**Result**: Within 2-3 years, you're back where you started

---

## Annual Review Goals

1. **Recapture savings** - Find 10-20% more savings from year's sprawl
2. **Update inventory** - Add new tools, remove canceled ones
3. **Re-score tools** - Usage changes over time
4. **Negotiate renewals** - Lock in better rates for next year
5. **Refine policies** - Fix governance gaps discovered during year

**Expected outcome**: Maintain 30-50% savings long-term

---

## Annual Review Checklist

### A. Inventory Refresh

**1. Find new tools added during year**

**Sources**:
- [ ] Accounting system (new recurring charges)
- [ ] SSO admin panels (new app connections)
- [ ] Department surveys (shadow IT discovery)
- [ ] Credit card statements (missed in accounting)

**Compare** to last year's inventory:
- How many tools added? (Target: <10 net new)
- Total new spend? (Target: <10% increase)
- Shadow IT tools? (Target: <5 unauthorized purchases)

---

**2. Remove canceled tools**

**Check**:
- [ ] Which tools were canceled during year?
- [ ] Are they fully deprovisioned?
- [ ] Any zombie subscriptions still billing?
- [ ] Data archived from canceled tools?

---

**3. Update costs and license counts**

**For each existing tool**:
- [ ] Current monthly cost (may have increased)
- [ ] Current user count (may have grown/shrunk)
- [ ] Plan tier (any upgrades/downgrades?)
- [ ] Renewal date (may have changed)

---

### B. Usage Re-Analysis

**1. Pull fresh usage data**

**From SSO**:
- [ ] Last login date for each user
- [ ] Active users last 30/60/90 days
- [ ] Utilization % (Active / Licensed)

**From tool analytics**:
- [ ] Feature usage (which features are used?)
- [ ] User activity (who's actually using it?)
- [ ] Growth trends (usage increasing or declining?)

---

**2. Re-score all tools**

**Use same 5-dimension framework** as initial audit:
- Usage Score (has utilization changed?)
- Value Score (is it still critical?)
- Overlap Score (new overlaps introduced?)
- Cost Efficiency Score (prices changed? cheaper alternatives emerged?)
- Strategic Fit Score (still aligned with tech stack?)

**Compare** to last year's scores:
- Which tools declined in score? (candidates for cancellation)
- Which improved? (maybe keep instead of consolidating)
- Which stayed same? (stable, low priority for changes)

---

### C. New Optimization Opportunities

**1. Identify new overlaps**

**Common patterns**:
- New tool added that overlaps with existing
- Department bought duplicate of company-approved tool
- Two tools merged (can consolidate licenses)

**Example**:
- Last year: Had Asana (company standard)
- This year: Marketing bought Monday independently
- Opportunity: Consolidate back to just Asana

---

**2. Check for usage decline**

**Red flags**:
- Utilization dropped from 80% → 40% (half the team stopped using it)
- Alternative tool gaining adoption (employees switching)
- Feature used is now available in other tool

**Example**:
- Last year: Loom had 8/10 users active (80% utilization)
- This year: Loom has 3/10 users active (30% utilization)
- Investigation: Team switched to OBS Studio (free)
- Opportunity: Cancel Loom, save $125/month

---

**3. Find departed employee licenses**

**Check**:
- Employees who left during year
- Are their licenses still active?
- Which tools have zombie licenses?

**Example**:
- 5 employees left during year
- Still paying for their Slack, Asana, HubSpot licenses
- Opportunity: Remove 5 licenses × $30/month avg = $150/month savings

---

**4. Evaluate new alternatives**

**Check**:
- Has better/cheaper alternative launched?
- Has competitor added must-have feature?
- Has pricing landscape changed?

**Example**:
- Last year: HubSpot was best CRM option
- This year: Freshsales added X feature, now viable at 57% lower cost
- Opportunity: Migrate HubSpot → Freshsales, save $510/month

---

### D. Renewal Negotiation Plan

**1. List all renewals next 6-12 months**

**For each renewal**:
- [ ] Tool name, current cost
- [ ] Renewal date
- [ ] Last negotiation outcome (what discount did we get?)
- [ ] Current score (Keep/Negotiate/Consolidate/Cancel decision)

---

**2. Research competitive landscape**

**For each tool**:
- [ ] What are current alternatives?
- [ ] What do they cost?
- [ ] Any new features in competing tools?
- [ ] When is vendor's fiscal quarter/year end?

---

**3. Set negotiation targets**

**For each renewal**:
- [ ] Target discount % (typical: 15-30%)
- [ ] Walk-away price (when do we switch?)
- [ ] Negotiation tactic to use (competitive quote, multi-year, etc.)
- [ ] Start date (60 days before renewal)

---

### E. Governance Policy Updates

**1. Review last year's governance**

**Metrics**:
- How many new tools added?
- How many went through approval process?
- Shadow IT % (unauthorized purchases)
- Quarterly review completion (did we do all 4?)

---

**2. Identify governance gaps**

**Common gaps**:
- Approval process too slow (employees bypass it)
- Quarterly reviews skipped (too busy)
- No enforcement (violations have no consequences)
- No SSO deprovisioning (manual license removal)

---

**3. Update policies for next year**

**Examples**:
- "Approval process was slow → reduce SLA to 1 business day"
- "Quarterly reviews skipped → assign dedicated owner (CFO)"
- "Shadow IT at 30% → block personal card expenses for SaaS"

**Cumulative savings**: $2,821/month ($33,852/year) vs original baseline

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Same Month Every Year

**Pick one month** (recommended: January) and stick to it

**Why January**:
- Post-holiday, budget planning season
- Many vendors' fiscal year end (Dec 31) = Q4 discounts still available
- New year = natural time for fresh start

---

### 2. Dedicate Owner

**Assign one person** (CFO, Operations Manager, or Head of IT)

**Their responsibility**:
- Complete annual review in designated month
- Own quarterly reviews
- Approve SaaS purchases
- Negotiate renewals

**Time commitment**: 8-12 hours/year

---

### 3. Automate Where Possible

**Use tools** to reduce manual work:
- SSO exports (automated usage reporting)
- Our [renewal-tracker.py](../scripts/renewal-tracker.py) (automated renewal reminders)
- Accounting reports (automated spend tracking)
- SCIM deprovisioning (automated license removal)

---

### 4. Share Results

**Communicate savings** to company:
- Send annual summary email to all employees
- Share in all-hands meeting
- Thank teams for cooperation
- Show ROI (hours invested → $ saved)

**Example**:
> "Thanks to our SaaS optimization efforts, we saved $33,852 in 2025 - that's equivalent to hiring another full-time employee or investing in our product roadmap."

---

## What's Next

**After Annual Review**:
1. Execute optimization plan (consolidate, cancel, negotiate)
2. Update governance policies
3. Set calendar reminders for quarterly reviews
4. Mark calendar for next year's annual review

**Repeat**: Every 12 months

**Result**: Sustained 30-50% SaaS savings year after year
