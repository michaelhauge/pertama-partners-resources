## What This Toolkit Checks

### Network Security
- Open ports exposed to the network (not just localhost)
- Firewall status and configuration
- File sharing services (SMB, AFP, NFS)
- Remote access services (SSH, VNC, RDP)
- Guest access on shared resources

### Credential Security
- `.env` files with world-readable permissions
- API keys and tokens in common locations
- SSH key permissions
- Cloud credential files (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Secrets accidentally committed to git

### System Hardening
- Disk encryption status
- Screen lock configuration
- Automatic updates
- Secure boot status

## Audit Scripts

| Script (macOS/Linux) | Script (Windows) | Description |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `full-audit.sh` | `full-audit.ps1` | Run all security checks |
| `network-audit.sh` | `network-audit.ps1` | Check network exposure only |
| `credential-audit.sh` | `credential-audit.ps1` | Check credential security only |

### Linux Script Features
- **Firewall detection**: UFW, firewalld, and iptables support

### Windows Script Features
- **Windows Firewall**: Checks all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
- **Windows Defender**: Antivirus status, real-time protection, signature age
- **Network exposure**: Uses `Get-NetTCPConnection` for port analysis
- **BitLocker**: Disk encryption status
- **UAC**: User Account Control verification
- **Remote Desktop**: RDP status and WinRM checks
- **Credential Manager**: Enumerates stored Windows credentials
- **Git integration**: Configures Windows Credential Manager for git

## Sample Output

```
=== SECURITY AUDIT REPORT ===
Date: 2024-01-15 14:30:00
System: macOS 14.2 (Sonoma)

[PASS] Firewall enabled
[PASS] Stealth mode enabled
[WARN] SSH exposed on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:22)
[FAIL] SMB guest access enabled
[PASS] All .env files have 600 permissions
[WARN] 2 credential files have 644 permissions

Summary: 2 PASS | 2 WARN | 1 FAIL
```

## What Goes Wrong and How to Fix It

### "The audit script won't run — permission denied"

**Symptom**: Running `./scripts/macos/full-audit.sh` returns "Permission denied" or "command not found."

**Likely cause**: The script doesn't have execute permissions, or you're running it from the wrong directory.

**Fix**:
1. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x scripts/macos/*.sh` (or `linux/*.sh`)
2. Verify you're in the right directory: `ls scripts/` should show `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/`
3. On macOS, if you get a Gatekeeper warning ("cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"), right-click → Open, or run: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine scripts/macos/full-audit.sh`

**Prevention**: After cloning the repo, always run `chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh` once to set all permissions.

### "I'm getting tons of FAIL/WARN results — is my machine compromised?"

**Symptom**: First audit run shows 15+ warnings and 5+ failures. Panic ensues.

**Likely cause**: Most developer machines haven't been hardened. Default OS configurations leave many ports open, permissions loose, and security features disabled. This doesn't mean you've been hacked — it means you have work to do.

**Fix**:
1. Don't panic — read each finding carefully. Most are configuration issues, not active threats
2. Prioritize: Fix FAIL items first (actual vulnerabilities), then WARN (best practices)
3. Use the remediation script: `./scripts/macos/remediate.sh` (or `--fix` flag on Linux) to auto-fix common issues
4. Re-run the audit after fixing: compare before/after scores

**Prevention**: Run the quick security check (`checklists/quick-security-check.md`) monthly. Schedule a full audit quarterly. Fixing issues incrementally is much less overwhelming than seeing 20 failures at once.

---

### "The audit found exposed credentials — what do I do?"

**Symptom**: Audit reports `.env` files with world-readable permissions, API keys in git history, or cloud credential files with loose permissions.

**Likely cause**: Default file creation permissions are often 644 (world-readable). Developers frequently commit `.env` files accidentally, and credential files from `aws configure` or `gcloud init` default to readable permissions.

**Fix**:
1. **Immediately rotate any exposed credentials** — change API keys, tokens, and passwords that were found
2. Fix permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials ~/.env` (owner-only read/write)
3. If credentials were committed to git: use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo Cleaner to remove from history
4. Add `.env` and credential files to `.gitignore`

**Prevention**: Add a pre-commit hook that blocks commits containing secrets (use `detect-secrets` or `gitleaks`). Set file creation umask to 077 in your shell profile.

---

### "Windows audit requires admin but I'm not an admin"

**Symptom**: PowerShell script fails with "Access Denied" or shows incomplete results because some checks require elevated privileges.

**Likely cause**: Many Windows security checks (BitLocker status, firewall configuration, Windows Defender settings) require administrator access. Non-admin users can only see a subset of the security posture.

**Fix**:
1. Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator" → re-run the script
2. If you're on a corporate machine without admin rights, run with `-SkipAdmin` flag to get partial results, then share the output with your IT team for the admin-required checks
3. Use the dry-run remediation: `.\scripts\windows\remediate.ps1 -DryRun` to see what would change without making changes

**Prevention**: Coordinate with your IT department before running audits on corporate machines. Share the toolkit documentation so they understand what the scripts check and can approve admin access.

---

### "Audit results differ between my Mac and my Linux server"

**Symptom**: Your Mac passes most checks but your Linux server fails many, or vice versa. The reports look completely different.

**Likely cause**: macOS and Linux have different default security configurations, different firewall systems (pf vs iptables/ufw), and different credential storage mechanisms. The scripts check platform-appropriate items, so results aren't directly comparable.

**Fix**:
1. This is expected behavior — don't try to make scores match across platforms
2. Focus on platform-specific priorities: macOS (FileVault, Gatekeeper, firewall), Linux (SSH hardening, fail2ban, LUKS encryption)
3. Use the platform-specific hardening guides (`guides/platform-specific/`) for remediation steps tailored to each OS
4. Compare against the same platform over time (not across platforms)

**Prevention**: Track audit scores per platform over time using the monthly maintenance checklist (`checklists/monthly-maintenance.md`). Aim for improvement trends, not cross-platform parity.
