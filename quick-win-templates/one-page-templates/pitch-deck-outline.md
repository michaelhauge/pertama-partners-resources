## The 10-Slide Pitch Deck Framework

### Slide 1: Cover / Title
**What to include**:
- Company name and logo
- One-sentence tagline: [What you do + for whom]
- Your name and title
- Contact: [email]
- Date and funding round: [e.g., "Series A - $5M raise"]

**Example**:

### Slide 2: Problem
**What to include**:
- **3 key pain points** your customers face
- Quantify the problem (cost, time, frequency)
- Show you deeply understand the pain

**Structure**:
```
1. [Pain point #1] → Costs [X] / Takes [Y hours] / Affects [Z people]
2. [Pain point #2] → [Quantified impact]
3. [Pain point #3] → [Quantified impact]

"Currently, [target customer] has to [painful current solution]..."
```

**Example**:
> **Urban millennials waste time and money on groceries:**
> 1. Supermarkets take 2+ hours/week (8 hours/month lost)
> 2. Food waste: 30% of groceries thrown away ($200/month wasted)
> 3. Unhealthy choices: 60% of purchases are processed foods
>
> "Currently, busy professionals buy groceries at the end of the day when they're tired, leading to impulse purchases and food waste."

### Slide 3: Solution
**What to include**:
- What you built (product description)
- How it solves the 3 pain points from Slide 2
- Key differentiator (what makes you unique)

**Structure**:
```
[Product name] is a [category] that helps [customer] [achieve outcome].

How we solve it:
✓ [Pain #1] → [Your solution]
✓ [Pain #2] → [Your solution]
✓ [Pain #3] → [Your solution]

Key differentiator: [What makes you 10x better, not 10% better]
```

**Example**:

>
> How we solve it:
> ✓ Save time: Pre-curated healthy baskets delivered in 2 hours
> ✓ Reduce waste: Portions sized for actual consumption (not bulk)
> ✓ Eat healthy: 80% fresh produce, 20% packaged goods (vs 40/60 in supermarkets)
>
> Key differentiator: Only zero-waste packaging (no plastic) + carbon-negative delivery (electric bikes)

3. [Regulatory/social change] → [Opens market]
```

**Example**:
> **3 reasons sustainable grocery is exploding in SEA:**
> 1. **ESG mandates**: Singapore's Green Plan 2030 requires businesses to cut waste by 30%
> 2. **Electric vehicle infrastructure**: 5,000+ EV charging points in SG (2x since 2024)

## Pro Tips

### 1. Tell a Story, Not Just Facts
**Bad**: "We have 8,500 customers and $1.2M ARR"
**Good**: "In 6 months, we went from 0 to 8,500 customers who've prevented 12 tons of plastic waste—equivalent to 1.2M plastic bags that would've ended up in the ocean."

### 2. Use Visuals, Not Walls of Text
- Each slide should have 1 main visual (chart, screenshot, photo)
- Maximum 50 words per slide
- Use large fonts (minimum 24pt)

### 3. Quantify Everything
- Don't say "growing fast" → Say "35% MoM growth for 6 months"
- Don't say "customers love us" → Say "72 NPS, 68% repeat rate"
- Don't say "large market" → Say "$18B market, growing 22% annually"

### 4. Show, Don't Tell
**Bad**: "We have a great product"
**Good**: [Screenshot] + "4.8★ App Store rating from 2,100 reviews"

### 5. Address Obvious Questions Preemptively
- If you're in a crowded market → Emphasize unfair advantage (Slide 10)
- If you're pre-revenue → Show LOIs, pilot results, or waitlist (Slide 8)
- If market size seems small → Show adjacent expansion opportunities (Slide 5)

### 6. Tailor to Your Audience
**Seed investors**: Focus on team, vision, early traction
**Series A investors**: Focus on unit economics, growth metrics, path to scale
**Series B investors**: Focus on market dominance, expansion plan, profitability

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too much text**: If you need to read the slide, it's too wordy
❌ **No clear ask**: Slide 13 should state exact amount + use of funds
❌ **Weak problem**: If the problem isn't painful, solution doesn't matter
❌ **No differentiation**: "We're like Uber but for X" → Why not just Uber?
❌ **Unrealistic projections**: 10x growth every year = not credible
❌ **No traction**: If pre-revenue, show SOMETHING (pilots, LOIs, waitlist, MVP)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fill out this outline** (30 minutes)
2. **Get feedback** from advisors/mentors (1-2 days)
3. **Design slides** (use Pitch, Canva, or hire designer)
4. **Practice pitch** (10+ times before first investor meeting)
5. **Iterate** based on investor questions

**Remember**: The deck gets you the meeting. The pitch gets you the term sheet. Practice delivery more than design.
