## Step 1: Revenue Plan

**Revenue Model**:
- [ ] Define revenue streams (SaaS subscriptions, services, transactions)
- [ ] Set growth targets (% MoM or QoQ)
- [ ] Account for seasonality
- [ ] Add conservative buffer (90% of projection)

**Example (SaaS Company - $2M ARR goal)**:

| Month | Starting MRR | New MRR | Churn | Ending MRR | ARR |
|-------|--------------|---------|-------|------------|-----|
| **Jan** | $120K | $15K | ($5K) | $130K | $1.56M |
| **Feb** | $130K | $16K | ($5K) | $141K | $1.69M |
| **Mar** | $141K | $17K | ($6K) | $152K | $1.82M |
| **Apr** | $152K | $18K | ($6K) | $164K | $1.97M |
| **May** | $164K | $19K | ($7K) | $176K | $2.11M |
| **Jun** | $176K | $20K | ($7K) | $189K | $2.27M |
| **Q1** | - | $48K | ($16K) | - | - |
| **Q2** | - | $57K | ($20K) | - | - |

**Growth rate**: 10% MoM (aggressive but achievable for early-stage)

---

## Step 2: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

**SaaS COGS** (typically 15-30% of revenue):
- Hosting / infrastructure (AWS, GCP, database)
- Payment processing fees (3% of revenue)
- Support costs (customer success team salaries)
- Third-party APIs (Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio)

**Example (SaaS - $2M ARR, 20% COGS)**:

| Category | Monthly | Annual | % of Revenue |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Hosting (AWS) | $8K | $96K | 5% |
| Payment processing (3%) | $5K | $60K | 3% |
| APIs / third-party tools | $4K | $48K | 2% |
| Support team (2 people) | $17K | $204K | 10% |
| **Total COGS** | **$34K** | **$408K** | **20%** |

**Gross Margin**: 80% (typical for SaaS)

---

## Step 3: Operating Expenses (OpEx)

**OpEx Categories**:
1. **Salaries & Benefits** (largest expense, 50-70% of budget)
2. **Marketing & Sales** (CAC-driven)
3. **General & Administrative** (G&A)
4. **Research & Development** (product team)

---

## Step 4: Total Budget Summary

**Annual P&L** (Profit & Loss):

| Line Item | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Annual |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|--------|
| **Revenue** | $420K | $529K | $641K | $757K | **$2,347K** |
| **COGS** (20%) | ($84K) | ($106K) | ($128K) | ($151K) | **($469K)** |
| **Gross Profit** | $336K | $423K | $513K | $606K | **$1,878K** |
|||||||
| **Operating Expenses** |||||||
| - Salaries & Benefits | $672K | $784K | $924K | $980K | $3,360K |
| - Marketing | $96K | $120K | $132K | $132K | $480K |

| **Net Burn/month** | $368K | $418K | $472K | $476K | **$433K avg** |
|||||||
| **Runway** (with $6M in bank) | 16 mo | 14 mo | 13 mo | 13 mo | 14 mo |

**Interpretation**:
- Company is burning $433K/month on average
- With $6M in bank, runway is ~14 months
- EBITDA negative (normal for growth-stage)
- Need to raise next round in 6-9 months (or become profitable)

---

## Step 5: Variance Tracking

**Monthly Review**:
- Compare actual vs budget
- Calculate variance (Actual - Budget)
- Identify reasons for variance
- Adjust forecast if needed

**Variance Analysis (Example - March)**:

| Category | Budget | Actual | Variance | Variance % | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| **Revenue** | $152K | $148K | ($4K) | -3% | Lost 1 deal, pushed to April |
| **COGS** | $30K | $32K | $2K | +7% | AWS overage (optimized) |
| **Salaries** | $224K | $224K | $0 | 0% | On target |
| **Marketing** | $40K | $38K | ($2K) | -5% | Paused LinkedIn ads |
| **Sales** | $79K | $82K | $3K | +4% | Extra travel to close deals |
| **G&A** | $30K | $33K | $3K | +10% | Legal fees (fundraise prep) |
| **R&D** | $115K | $118K | $3K | +3% | Contractor overage |
| **Total Spend** | $518K | $527K | $9K | +2% | Slightly over budget |
| **Net Burn** | $366K | $379K | $13K | +4% | Watch for next month |

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Close 2 deals in April to make up revenue shortfall
- [ ] Optimize AWS spend (move to reserved instances)
- [ ] Pause non-essential contractors in R&D

## Budget Best Practices

### Rule 1: Be Conservative on Revenue, Realistic on Expenses

**Revenue**: Assume 70-90% of ambitious targets
**Expenses**: Assume 100-110% (things always cost more)

---

### Rule 2: Build in 10-15% Buffer

**Unplanned expenses always arise**:
- Emergency hires
- Legal/tax issues
- Market changes
- Customer churn

Add 10-15% buffer to total OpEx budget.

---

### Rule 3: Review Monthly, Adjust Quarterly

**Monthly**: Check actuals vs budget, explain variances
**Quarterly**: Reforecast remaining quarters based on trends

---

### Rule 4: Tie Budget to Goals

Every dollar should map to a goal:
- Revenue → Sales & Marketing spend
- Product → R&D spend
- Retention → Customer Success spend

**Example**:
- Goal: $2M ARR
- Sales target: 200 customers at $10K ACV
- Sales budget: $1.2M (CAC = $6K per customer)

---

## Budget by Company Stage

### Pre-Seed ($0-500K ARR)
- Headcount: 3-8 people (mostly engineering)
- Burn: $30-80K/month
- Focus: Build product, find PMF
- Budget breakdown: 70% R&D, 20% Sales, 10% G&A

### Seed ($500K-2M ARR)
- Headcount: 8-20 people
- Burn: $80-250K/month
- Focus: Prove repeatable sales motion
- Budget breakdown: 40% R&D, 40% Sales & Marketing, 20% G&A

### Series A ($2M-10M ARR)
- Headcount: 20-50 people
- Burn: $250-600K/month
- Focus: Scale what works
- Budget breakdown: 30% R&D, 50% Sales & Marketing, 20% G&A

### Series B ($10M-30M ARR)
- Headcount: 50-150 people
- Burn: $600K-2M/month
- Focus: Market leadership
- Budget breakdown: 25% R&D, 55% Sales & Marketing, 20% G&A

## Common Budget Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Underestimating Hiring Costs

**Wrong**: "We need 5 engineers at $100K = $500K"
**Right**: "5 engineers × $100K × 1.3 (benefits, taxes) × 1.2 (recruiting, ramp) = $780K"

**Hidden costs**:
- Recruiting fees (20-25% of first-year salary)
- Benefits (20-30% of salary)
- Ramp time (3-6 months to full productivity)
- Onboarding (IT, training, admin time)

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Ignoring Runway

**Burn rate without considering cash in bank**

**Example**:
- Cash: $3M
- Burn: $300K/month
- Runway: 10 months

**Problem**: Need to raise money in 6 months (not 10) to allow time for fundraising.

**Rule**: Start fundraising when you have 6-9 months runway left.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Adjusting for Seasonality

**B2B SaaS**:
- Q4: Strong (companies spending remaining budget)
- Q1: Weak (new budget approvals take time)
- Summer: Slow (vacations, decision-makers away)

**E-commerce**:
- Q4: Very strong (holiday shopping)
- Q1: Weak (post-holiday lull)

Adjust revenue projections accordingly.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Fixed vs Variable Costs

**Fixed costs** (don't scale with revenue):
- Salaries
- Office rent
- Software subscriptions

**Variable costs** (scale with revenue):
- COGS (hosting, support)
- Payment processing
- Commissions

**Problem**: Over-hiring (fixed costs) when revenue is uncertain.

**Solution**: Keep fixed costs <70% of budget, variable costs >30% for flexibility.

---

## Google Sheets Formula Reference

**Revenue (MRR to ARR)**:
```
=MRR * 12
```

**Gross Margin %**:
```
=(REVENUE - COGS) / REVENUE
```

**Burn Rate (Monthly)**:
```
=TOTAL_EXPENSES - TOTAL_REVENUE
```

**Runway (Months)**:
```
=CASH_IN_BANK / MONTHLY_BURN
```

**Variance %**:
```
=(ACTUAL - BUDGET) / BUDGET
```

**Headcount Cost (Fully Loaded)**:
```
=SALARY * 1.3 (for benefits, taxes, overhead)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Gather historical data** (last 6-12 months of spending)
2. **Set revenue targets** (realistic, with buffer)
3. **Plan headcount** (when to hire, what roles)
4. **Allocate budget by department** (tie to goals)
5. **Build 3 scenarios** (base case, upside, downside)
6. **Review with team** (get buy-in from department heads)
7. **Track monthly** (actuals vs budget)
8. **Adjust quarterly** (based on performance)
