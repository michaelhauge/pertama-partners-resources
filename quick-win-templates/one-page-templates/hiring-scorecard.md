# Hiring Scorecard (1-Page)

**Purpose**: Standardize candidate evaluation and reduce hiring bias
**Time to Complete**: 15-20 minutes per candidate
**Use Case**: Any role, any level (adjust criteria per role)
**Output**: Scored evaluation for consistent hiring decisions

---

## Why Use a Hiring Scorecard?

**Without scorecard**:
- ❌ "I have a good feeling about this person" (gut decisions)
- ❌ Different interviewers assess different things
- ❌ Bias creeps in (recency bias, halo effect, similarity bias)
- ❌ Can't compare candidates objectively

**With scorecard**:
- ✅ Every candidate evaluated on same criteria
- ✅ Reduces bias (structured evaluation)
- ✅ Easy to compare candidates (numerical scores)
- ✅ Defensible hiring decisions (data-backed)

**Experience validation**:
- "Show me a project you're most proud of. Why?"

---

### Cultural Fit

**Ownership**:
- "Tell me about a time you saw a problem and fixed it without being asked."
- "When have you taken ownership of a failure?"

**Growth Mindset**:
- "What's something you're not good at, and how are you improving?"
- "Tell me about a time you received hard feedback. What did you do?"

**Collaboration**:
- "How do you handle disagreements with teammates?"
- "Tell me about a time you helped someone else succeed."

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Fill Out Scorecard Immediately After Interview

**Don't wait**:
- ❌ "I'll do it later" → You forget details
- ✅ Take 10 minutes right after interview

---

### 2. Require Evidence for Every Score

**Bad**: "Communication: 5/5 - They were good"
**Good**: "Communication: 5/5 - Explained system design clearly, asked clarifying questions, listened actively when I gave feedback"

---

### 3. Calibrate Across Interviewers

**Weekly**: Review 2-3 candidates as a team
**Compare scores**: Are we aligned on what "4/5" means?
**Adjust**: "I think I'm scoring too harsh" or "too lenient"

---

### 4. Don't Ignore Red Flags

**One red flag**: Maybe a bad day
**Two red flags**: Proceed with caution
**Three+ red flags**: Pass

---

### 5. Hire for Trajectory, Not Just Current Skills

**Question**: "Can they do the job today?"
**Better question**: "Can they grow into the role and beyond?"

**Example**:
- Candidate A: 40/40 skills, 20/30 culture, 12/20 potential = 72/100
- Candidate B: 32/40 skills, 28/30 culture, 19/20 potential = 79/100
- **Hire B** (will grow faster, better culture fit)

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Adjusting Criteria Per Candidate

**Wrong**: "Sarah was great, let me add 'public speaking' to the scorecard"
**Right**: Lock criteria before interviews, same for all candidates

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Scoring Everyone High (Grade Inflation)

**Wrong**: Everyone gets 4-5 on everything
**Right**: Use full scale (3 = meets expectations, 4 = exceeds, 5 = exceptional)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Letting One Factor Dominate (Halo Effect)

**Wrong**: "They went to Stanford, so 5/5 on everything"
**Right**: Score each criterion independently

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Culture Fit

**Wrong**: "They're technically brilliant, culture doesn't matter"
**Right**: Culture mismatch → eventual attrition, even with great skills

---

## Scorecard Tools

**Manual**:
- Google Sheets (shared with hiring team)
- Notion (database with candidate views)

**Software**:
- Lever ($$$) - ATS with scorecards built-in
- Greenhouse ($$$) - Structured interview kits
- Ashby ($$) - Modern ATS with scorecards

**Recommendation**: Start with Google Sheets (free), upgrade when >50 employees.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Customize scorecard** for your role (adjust skills, criteria)
2. **Share with interviewers** (align on criteria before interviews)
3. **Practice on next 3 candidates** (get comfortable with scoring)
4. **Calibrate as team** (compare scores, align on standards)
5. **Iterate** (adjust criteria based on what predicts success)
