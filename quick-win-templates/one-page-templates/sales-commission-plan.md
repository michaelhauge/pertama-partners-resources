# Sales Commission Plan (1-Page)

**Purpose**: Design commission structure to motivate sales team
**Time to Complete**: 2-4 hours (initial design), quarterly review
**Use Case**: Founders, VP Sales, Finance designing comp plans for sales reps
**Output**: Commission structure with quota, rates, accelerators, caps

---

## Why Commission Plans Matter

**Sales commissions drive behavior**. The right plan aligns sales team with company goals (new customers, expansion, retention). The wrong plan incentivizes bad behavior (short-term deals, discounting, churn).

**Key Goals**:
- **Motivate performance**: Reward top performers
- **Align with business**: Pay for outcomes that matter (ARR, not just revenue)
- **Predictable**: Easy to understand and calculate
- **Fair**: Same effort = same pay across territories

**Company**: [Company Name]
**Period**: [Year/Quarter]
**Role**: Account Executive (AE)
**Target**: $1M ARR per year

### Base Salary + Commission Mix

**Total OTE (On-Target Earnings)**: $150K/year

| Component | Amount | % of OTE | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Base Salary** | $90K | 60% | Paid regardless of performance |
| **Variable (Commission)** | $60K | 40% | Paid when quota is hit |
| **Total OTE** | $150K | 100% | At 100% quota attainment |

**OTE Ratio**: 60/40 (base/variable)

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- **SDR/BDR**: 70/30 (more stable)
- **AE**: 60/40 or 50/50 (performance-based)
- **Senior AE/Enterprise**: 50/50 (higher risk, higher reward)

---

### Quota & Commission Rate

**Annual Quota**: $1M ARR (new + expansion)
**Quarterly Quota**: $250K ARR

**Commission Rate**: 6% of ARR closed

**Calculation**:
- Quota: $1M ARR
- Commission target: $60K
- Rate: $60K ÷ $1M = **6% of ARR**

**Example**:
- Rep closes $1M ARR → Earns $60K commission (100% of target)
- Rep closes $500K ARR → Earns $30K commission (50% of target)
- Rep closes $1.5M ARR → Earns $90K commission (150% of target)

---

## Commission Structure Options

### Option 1: Flat Rate (Simplest)

**Rate**: 6% of ARR, no matter what

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to understand
- ✅ Easy to calculate
- ✅ Predictable

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't reward over-performance
- ❌ Doesn't penalize under-performance

**Best For**: Small teams (1-5 reps), early-stage startups

---

### Option 2: Tiered Rate (Most Common)

**Rate increases as quota attainment increases**

| Quota Attainment | Commission Rate | Example Earnings |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **0-50%** | 3% | $250K ARR → $7.5K |
| **50-100%** | 6% | $750K ARR → $45K |
| **100-150%** | 9% | $1.25M ARR → $112.5K |
| **150%+** | 12% | $1.5M ARR → $180K |

**Accelerators**: Rate increases at 100% and 150% quota attainment to reward over-performance

**Why This Works**:
- Motivates hitting quota (rate jumps at 100%)
- Rewards top performers (12% vs 6%)
- Fair to under-performers (still earn 3%)

**Best For**: Most B2B SaaS companies

---

### Option 3: Stepped Commission (Pay More for Core Business)

**Different rates for different product lines or deal types**

| Deal Type | Commission Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **New Customers** | 10% | Priority: net new logos |
| **Expansion (Upsell)** | 6% | Existing customers |
| **Renewal** | 3% | Keep existing ARR |
| **Enterprise (>$100K)** | 8% | Harder deals, higher value |

**Example**:
- Rep closes $500K new ARR → $50K commission (10%)
- Rep upsells $300K existing customers → $18K commission (6%)
- Rep renews $200K ARR → $6K commission (3%)
- **Total**: $74K commission on $1M ARR

**Why This Works**: Pays more for what matters most (new customers)

**Best For**: Companies prioritizing new customer acquisition over expansion

---

## Quota Components

**Total Quota**: $1M ARR (100%)

**Breakdown**:

| Component | Target | % of Quota | Commission Rate |
|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **New Customers** | $600K | 60% | 10% |
| **Expansion** | $300K | 30% | 6% |
| **Renewal** | $100K | 10% | 3% |

**Why Split Quota?**
- Prevents reps from only focusing on easy expansion deals
- Forces balance between new logos and expansion
- Aligns with company growth strategy

---

## Commission Accelerators

**Accelerators** = Higher commission rates for over-performance

### Example: Tiered Accelerators

| Quota Attainment | Commission Rate | Multiplier |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **0-80%** | 3% | 0.5x |
| **80-100%** | 6% | 1x |
| **100-120%** | 9% | 1.5x |
| **120%+** | 12% | 2x |

**Example Earnings**:
- 50% quota ($500K ARR) → $15K commission (3% × $500K)
- 100% quota ($1M ARR) → $60K commission (6% × $1M)
- 150% quota ($1.5M ARR) → $135K commission (9% × $1M + 12% × $500K)

**Why Accelerators Work**:
- Top performers earn 2-3x average performers
- Creates urgency to hit 100% (rate jumps)
- Rewards exceeding expectations

---

## Commission Caps

**Should you cap commissions?**

**Option 1: No Cap (Recommended)**
- ✅ Unlimited upside motivates top performers
- ✅ Aligns company and rep (more sales = more revenue)
- ✅ Attracts A-players

**Option 2: Soft Cap (At 200% Quota)**
- After 200% quota, rate drops from 12% → 6%
- Prevents windfalls from one-time huge deals
- ❌ Demotivates top performers

**Option 3: Hard Cap (At 300% OTE)**
- Rep can't earn more than $450K (3x OTE)
- Protects company from overpaying
- ❌ Demotivates top performers, causes sandbagging

**Recommendation**: No cap. If a rep sells $3M ARR (3x quota), they deserve to earn $300K+ commission.

---

## Clawbacks & Payouts

### Clawback Policy

**Clawback** = Taking back commission if customer churns early

**Example Policy**:
- If customer churns within 90 days → 100% clawback
- If customer churns within 180 days → 50% clawback
- After 180 days → No clawback (commission fully earned)

**Why Clawbacks?**
- Prevents reps from selling to bad-fit customers
- Aligns incentives (quality > quantity)

---

### Payout Schedule

**When does rep get paid?**

**Option 1: Monthly** (Most Common)
- Pay commission within 30 days of deal closing
- Easy to track, good cash flow for reps

**Option 2: Quarterly**
- Pay after quarter closes (based on quarterly quota)
- Better for company cash flow
- ❌ Reps prefer monthly

**Option 3: Annual**
- Pay entire commission at end of year
- ❌ Bad for retention (reps leave before payout)

**Recommendation**: Monthly payout, 30 days after deal closes

---

## Commission Plan by Role

### SDR/BDR (Sales Development Rep)

**Role**: Generate qualified leads for AEs

**OTE**: $70K (base: $50K, variable: $20K)
**Split**: 70/30 (base/variable)

**Quota**: 15 SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads) per month

**Commission**: $1,333 per SQL (or $400/meeting booked)

**Example**:
- 15 SQLs → $20K commission (100% of target)
- 20 SQLs → $26.6K commission (133% of target)

---

### AE (Account Executive)

**Role**: Close new customers

**OTE**: $150K (base: $90K, variable: $60K)
**Split**: 60/40 (base/variable)

**Quota**: $1M ARR per year

**Commission**: 6% of ARR (accelerates at 100% and 150%)

---

### Senior AE / Enterprise AE

**Role**: Close large enterprise deals ($100K+ ARR)

**OTE**: $250K (base: $125K, variable: $125K)
**Split**: 50/50 (base/variable)

**Quota**: $2M ARR per year

**Commission**: 6.25% of ARR (higher risk, higher reward)

---

### Customer Success Manager (CSM)

**Role**: Drive retention and expansion

**OTE**: $120K (base: $90K, variable: $30K)
**Split**: 75/25 (base/variable)

**Quota**:
- Retention: 95% GRR (Gross Revenue Retention)
- Expansion: $300K expansion ARR

**Commission**:
- Retention: $15K if GRR ≥ 95%
- Expansion: 5% of expansion ARR

---

## Commission Plan Examples

### Example 1: Early-Stage SaaS (Seed)

**Company**: 10 customers, $500K ARR, growing to $2M ARR

**Sales Team**: 2 AEs

**AE Comp**:
- OTE: $120K (base: $75K, variable: $45K)
- Quota: $750K ARR per year
- Commission: 6% flat rate (simple, no accelerators)

**Why This Works**: Simple plan, easy to understand, aligns with growth goals

---

### Example 2: Growth-Stage SaaS (Series A)

**Company**: 100 customers, $5M ARR, growing to $15M ARR

**Sales Team**: 8 AEs, 6 SDRs, 2 CSMs

**AE Comp**:
- OTE: $150K (base: $90K, variable: $60K)
- Quota: $1.25M ARR per year
- Commission: Tiered (3%/6%/9%/12% based on quota attainment)

**SDR Comp**:
- OTE: $70K (base: $50K, variable: $20K)
- Quota: 15 SQLs per month
- Commission: $1,333 per SQL

**CSM Comp**:
- OTE: $120K (base: $90K, variable: $30K)
- Quota: 95% GRR + $300K expansion ARR
- Commission: Retention bonus + 5% expansion

**Why This Works**: Balances new customers (AEs), pipeline (SDRs), retention (CSMs)

---

## Common Commission Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Complex

**Wrong**: 10-page commission plan with 20 different rates, carve-outs, exceptions
**Right**: 1-page plan with 3-5 clear rates

**Why**: Reps can't sell if they don't understand comp plan. Keep it simple.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Paying for Activity (Not Outcomes)

**Wrong**: Commission for demos booked, emails sent, calls made
**Right**: Commission for deals closed, ARR booked

**Why**: Pay for outcomes (revenue), not activity (effort)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Accelerators

**Wrong**: Flat 6% rate, no matter what
**Right**: 6% base, 9% at 100% quota, 12% at 150%

**Why**: Accelerators motivate over-performance. Top reps want upside.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Capping Commission

**Wrong**: "You can't earn more than $300K"
**Right**: No cap (or very high soft cap at 300% quota)

**Why**: Caps demotivate top performers. If rep sells $5M ARR, let them earn $500K.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Paying on Bookings (Not Collections)

**Wrong**: Pay commission when deal is signed
**Right**: Pay when customer pays first invoice (or after 90 days)

**Why**: Prevents reps from closing bad-fit customers who churn immediately

---

## Commission Plan Checklist

**Before Finalizing**:
- [ ] OTE is competitive (benchmark against market)
- [ ] Base/variable split aligns with role risk (60/40 for AE, 70/30 for SDR)
- [ ] Quota is realistic (80% of reps should hit 80%+ of quota)
- [ ] Commission rate is clear (rep can calculate in 30 seconds)
- [ ] Accelerators exist (reward over-performance)
- [ ] Clawback policy protects company (churn within 90 days)
- [ ] Payout schedule is clear (monthly, 30 days after close)
- [ ] Plan document is 1-2 pages (not 10 pages)

**After Launch**:
- [ ] Track quota attainment (80% of reps hit 80%+)
- [ ] Track commission spend (% of revenue)
- [ ] Gather feedback from reps (is it fair? motivating?)
- [ ] Review quarterly (adjust rates, quotas, accelerators)

## Benchmarks

### OTE by Role (B2B SaaS, SEA)

| Role | OTE Range | Base | Variable | Split |
|------|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| **SDR/BDR** | $50-80K | $35-60K | $15-20K | 70/30 |
| **AE** | $120-180K | $70-110K | $50-70K | 60/40 |
| **Senior AE** | $180-250K | $90-125K | $90-125K | 50/50 |
| **Enterprise AE** | $250-400K | $125-200K | $125-200K | 50/50 |
| **CSM** | $80-140K | $60-105K | $20-35K | 75/25 |
| **VP Sales** | $250-500K | $150-300K | $100-200K | 60/40 |

**Note**: SEA salaries 20-40% lower than US for same role

---

### Commission as % of Revenue

**Target**: 8-12% of revenue goes to sales commissions

**Example**:
- Revenue: $10M ARR
- Sales team: 10 AEs (avg OTE: $150K)
- Total comp: $1.5M base + variable
- **Commission %**: 15% (high, need to optimize)

**Benchmarks**:
- **Efficient**: 8-10% (AEs closing $1M+ ARR each)
- **Target**: 10-12% (AEs closing $700K-1M ARR)
- **High**: 15%+ (AEs closing <$500K ARR, too many reps)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Benchmark OTE** (is your comp competitive?)
2. **Choose structure** (flat, tiered, or stepped)
3. **Set quota** (80% of reps should hit 80%+)
4. **Calculate rate** (commission target ÷ quota)
5. **Add accelerators** (9% at 100%, 12% at 150%)
6. **Define clawbacks** (churn within 90 days)
7. **Write 1-page plan** (keep it simple)
8. **Get feedback** (show to top reps before launch)
9. **Review quarterly** (adjust based on attainment data)
