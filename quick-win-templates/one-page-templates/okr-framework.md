- **Key Results**: How you'll measure success (quantitative, specific)

- **Key Results**:
  - KR1: Reach 25,000 active customers (from 8,500)
  - KR2: Achieve 75% repeat purchase rate (from 68%)
  - KR3: Reduce CAC to $28 (from $38)

## How to Write Good Objectives

### Formula: [Action Verb] + [Inspiring Outcome]

**Good objectives**:
- ✅ "Become the most loved grocery brand in Singapore"
- ✅ "Build a product customers can't live without"
- ✅ "Scale profitably to 50,000 customers"

**Bad objectives**:
- ❌ "Increase revenue" (not inspiring)
- ❌ "Improve product" (too vague)
- ❌ "Hire 5 people" (that's a key result, not an objective)

### Characteristics of Good Objectives:
1. **Inspiring**: Gets the team excited
2. **Qualitative**: Describes a state, not a number
3. **Ambitious**: Should feel like a stretch (70% confidence you'll hit it)
4. **Time-bound**: Quarterly (not annual)
5. **Aligned**: Supports company strategy

---

## How to Write Good Key Results

### Formula: [Metric] from [X] to [Y] by [date]

**Good key results**:
- ✅ "Increase active customers from 8,500 to 25,000 by June 30"
- ✅ "Launch in Kuala Lumpur with 500 customers by June 30"
- ✅ "Reduce CAC from $38 to $28 by June 30"

**Bad key results**:
- ❌ "Get more customers" (no baseline, no target, no date)
- ❌ "Work on KL launch" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Improve CAC" (no target)

### Characteristics of Good Key Results:
1. **Measurable**: Number, percentage, or binary (yes/no)
2. **Specific**: Includes baseline, target, date
3. **Achievable**: Aggressive but realistic (70% confidence)
4. **Outcome-focused**: Results, not activities
5. **Limited**: 3-4 KRs per objective (not 10)

---

## OKR Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Too Many OKRs
**Problem**: 8 objectives with 40 key results
**Why bad**: No focus, team doesn't know what matters
**Fix**: Max 3-5 objectives with 3-4 KRs each (9-20 total KRs)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Sandbagging (Setting Easy Targets)
**Problem**: KR is "Reach 10,000 customers" when you're at 9,500
**Why bad**: No stretch, no growth
**Fix**: Set ambitious targets (70% confidence, not 95%)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Activities Instead of Outcomes
**Problem**: KR is "Run 10 A/B tests" instead of "Increase conversion by 15%"
**Why bad**: You can do activities without achieving outcomes
**Fix**: Focus on results (what changes), not inputs (what you do)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Unchanging OKRs
**Problem**: Same OKRs every quarter
**Why bad**: Business evolves, priorities shift
**Fix**: Refresh OKRs every quarter based on progress

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: No Tracking
**Problem**: Set OKRs in January, review in April
**Why bad**: No course-correction, surprises at the end
**Fix**: Weekly check-ins (5-10 min) on progress

---

## OKR Scoring

At end of quarter, score each key result:

- **0.0 - 0.3**: Failed (red)
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Made progress (yellow)
- **0.7 - 1.0**: Achieved (green)

**Example**:
- **KR1**: Reach 25,000 customers (from 8,500)
  - Actual: 20,000 customers
  - Score: 0.68 (green) = (20,000 - 8,500) / (25,000 - 8,500)

**What's a good average score?**
- 0.7 - 0.8: Perfect (ambitious but achievable)
- 0.9 - 1.0: Sandbagging (set easier targets next quarter)
- 0.4 - 0.6: Too ambitious (dial back next quarter)

---

## OKR Process (90-Day Cycle)

### Week 1 of Quarter: Set OKRs
1. **Day 1-2**: Leadership drafts company OKRs
2. **Day 3**: Department heads draft team OKRs (aligned with company)
3. **Day 4**: Review and finalize
4. **Day 5**: All-hands kickoff (present OKRs to company)

### Week 2-12: Execute and Track
- **Weekly**: 10-minute team standup on OKR progress
- **Bi-weekly**: Update OKR dashboard with latest numbers
- **Monthly**: Leadership reviews at-risk OKRs, adjusts resources

### Week 13: Review and Reflect
1. **Day 1-2**: Score all OKRs (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
2. **Day 3**: Retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
3. **Day 4-5**: Draft next quarter's OKRs

| Objective | Key Result | Owner | Target | Current | % Complete | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------|--------|---------|------------|--------|
| **O1: Dominate SG** | ||||||
| | KR1: 25K customers | Jane | 25,000 | 20,000 | 80% | 🟢 |

| **O2: Best product** | ||||||
| | KR1: AI meal planner | Michael | 50% | 45% | 90% | 🟢 |
| | KR2: 90 min delivery | Sarah | 90 min | 105 min | 50% | 🟡 |
| | KR3: 4.9★ rating | Jane | 4.9 | 4.85 | 50% | 🟡 |

**Status**:
- 🟢 Green: On track (≥70% to target)
- 🟡 Yellow: At risk (40-69% to target)

## OKR Best Practices

### 1. Cascade from Top-Down
**Company OKRs** → **Department OKRs** → **Individual OKRs**

**Example flow**:
- **Company**: Reach $10M ARR
- **Sales**: Close $7M in new business
- **Sales Rep**: Close $700K quota

### 2. Limit to 3-5 Objectives
- More than 5 objectives = no focus
- "If everything is important, nothing is important"

### 3. Make KRs Measurable
- ✅ "Increase NPS from 45 to 65"
- ❌ "Improve customer satisfaction"

### 4. Weekly Check-Ins
- Spend 10 minutes in Monday team meeting reviewing OKR progress
- Flag at-risk KRs early (don't wait until end of quarter)

### 5. Separate OKRs from Performance Reviews
- OKRs are stretch goals (70% confidence)
- Performance reviews should be 95%+ confidence
- Don't penalize people for missing ambitious OKRs

## Common Questions

**Q: Should OKRs be top-down or bottom-up?**
A: Hybrid. Company OKRs are top-down (leadership sets). Department/individual OKRs are bottom-up (teams propose, leadership approves).

**Q: What if we're off track at Week 6?**
A: Course-correct. Either adjust tactics to get back on track, OR adjust the OKR if assumptions changed (rare).

**Q: Should we have annual OKRs?**
A: No. Quarterly only. Business moves too fast for annual planning.

**Q: How many hours per week should I spend on OKRs?**
A: 10-30 minutes per week (check-ins). Most time is spent DOING the work, not tracking OKRs.

**Q: What if different teams have conflicting OKRs?**
A: Red flag. Align OKRs in planning phase. Example: Sales wants to close 100 deals, but Eng can only onboard 50 → Resolve before quarter starts.
