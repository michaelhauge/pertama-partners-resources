## Alternative Format: Narrative Style

**Some investors prefer narrative over bullets**. Here's an alternative:

---

**Subject**: Acme Update - January 2026 - Strong Start to the Year

Hi [Investor Name],

Hope you're doing well! Here's what happened at Acme in January:

**The Big News**: We crossed $100K MRR this month, putting us at a $1.2M ARR run rate. This was driven by strong new customer acquisition (15 new customers) and upsells (5 customers upgraded to Pro). We also signed our first enterprise deal with BigCorp ($50K contract) after an 8-month sales cycle—our longest deal to date, but worth it.

**What's Working**: Our new analytics dashboard (launched mid-month) is resonating. 20% of users adopted it in the first week, and early feedback is overwhelmingly positive. We also got great press coverage in TechCrunch SEA, which drove 5K new website visitors.

**What's Hard**: Sales cycles are taking longer than expected (6-8 months for enterprise vs our target of 3-4 months). We're competing with established players who have stronger brand recognition. We've hired a sales consultant to help tighten our process. Also, our mobile app has stability issues that are causing ~10% of users to churn. The engineering team is prioritizing this for Q1.

**Next Month's Focus**: Close 3 enterprise deals ($150K pipeline), ship mobile v2.1 (fix stability), and hire 2 engineers (backend + mobile).

**How You Can Help**: I'm looking for intros to VP Engineering candidates (backend eng lead, 5+ years, scale experience) and potential customers in fintech/e-commerce ($10M-100M revenue). Let me know if anyone comes to mind!

Thanks for your support—always happy to chat if you have thoughts on our enterprise sales strategy.

Best,
[Founder Name]

- **Asks** (1-3 specific requests)

- **Excuses**: "We missed target because..." (own it, then explain what you're doing)

---

## Frequency & Timing

### Pre-Seed/Seed (Monthly)
**When**: First Friday of each month
**Why**: High touch, need investor support for intros, hires, advice

### Series A (Monthly or Quarterly)
**When**: Quarterly + monthly for board members

### Series B+ (Quarterly)
**When**: After each quarter closes
**Why**: Less dependent on investors, focus on execution

- Stay confident (we'll figure this out)

**Tone**: Transparent but optimistic ("Facing challenges, but here's our plan")

**Example**:
"MRR grew only 2% this month (target: 10%). Sales cycle is longer than expected (6 months vs 4 months). We're hiring a sales consultant to tighten our process and expect to see improvement by end of Q1. In the meantime, we're focusing on product improvements to reduce churn."

- Ask for specific help (intros, advice, bridge round)

**Tone**: Urgent but composed ("We need help, here's what we need")

**Example**:
"We have a cash flow issue. Runway is 4 months (down from 12 months) due to slower-than-expected sales. We're cutting burn by 40% (pausing hires, reducing marketing spend) and raising a $1M bridge round. If you know investors interested in bridge rounds or can make warm intros, please let me know ASAP."
