## Why a Financial Dashboard?

**Without dashboard**:
- ❌ "How are we doing?" → 2 hours to pull reports
- ❌ Different numbers from different people
- ❌ Reactive (discover problems too late)

**With dashboard**:
- ✅ Answer "How are we doing?" in 30 seconds
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Proactive (catch problems early)

## How to Set Up Your Dashboard

### Step 1: Choose Your Tool

**Simple** (Recommended for startups):
- Google Sheets (free, easy to share)
- Notion (database views)
- Airtable (database + visualizations)

**Advanced** (For Series A+):
- Metabase (open-source BI)
- ChartMogul (SaaS-specific)
- Looker/Tableau (enterprise BI)

**Recommendation**: Start with Google Sheets. Upgrade to Metabase/ChartMogul when >50 people.

---

### Step 2: Connect Data Sources

**Manual** (Early-stage):
- Export data from Stripe, QuickBooks, bank monthly
- Copy-paste into Google Sheets
- Update formulas

**Automated** (Later-stage):
- Zapier (connect Stripe → Google Sheets)
- Segment (warehouse → BI tool)
- Native integrations (ChartMogul ← Stripe)

---

### Step 3: Set Update Frequency

| Metric | Frequency | Who Updates |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Cash in bank | Daily | CFO/Founder |
| MRR | Weekly | Finance/RevOps |
| Churn | Monthly | CS/RevOps |
| CAC/LTV | Monthly | Finance |
| Burn rate | Monthly | CFO |

---

### Step 4: Share with Team

**Who sees what**:
- **Full dashboard**: Founders, executives, board
- **Department metrics**: Department heads (Sales sees sales metrics)
- **High-level summary**: All employees (transparency)

**Where to share**:
- Monthly all-hands (show 5-10 key metrics)
- Weekly leadership meeting (review full dashboard)
- Slack channel (automated updates from dashboard)

---

## Example: Early-Stage SaaS Dashboard

### Summary (Top of Dashboard)

**Company**: GreenCart (Sustainable Grocery Delivery)
**As of**: February 2026
**Stage**: Seed ($2M raised 8 months ago)

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Financial Health** | 🟡 | 10 months runway, need to extend |
| **Growth** | 🟢 | MRR growing 13% MoM |
| **Unit Economics** | 🟢 | LTV:CAC 3.2:1, payback 9 months |
| **Product** | 🟢 | 4% churn (below 5% target) |

---

### Key Metrics (Last 6 Months)

| Month | MRR | Customers | Churn | CAC | Burn | Runway |
|-------|-----|-----------|-------|-----|------|--------|
| Sep 25 | $50K | 100 | 6% | $600 | $180K | 11 mo |
| Oct 25 | $55K | 110 | 5% | $550 | $175K | 11 mo |
| Nov 25 | $62K | 124 | 5% | $530 | $170K | 11 mo |
| Dec 25 | $68K | 136 | 5% | $510 | $165K | 11 mo |
| Jan 26 | $75K | 150 | 5% | $500 | $160K | 10 mo |
| Feb 26 | $85K | 170 | 4% | $450 | $150K | 10 mo |

**Trends**:
- ✅ MRR accelerating (13% MoM vs 10% avg)
- ✅ Churn improving (6% → 4%)
- ✅ CAC decreasing ($600 → $450)
- 🟡 Runway flat (need to cut burn or grow faster)

---

### Action Items (Bottom of Dashboard)

**This Month's Priorities**:
1. 🔴 **Extend runway**: Cut burn to $130K/month (freeze 2 planned hires)
2. 🟢 **Improve CAC**: Launch referral program (target CAC <$400)
3. 🟢 **Reduce churn**: Implement customer success program (target <3%)

---

## Dashboard Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple

**Bad**: 50 metrics on one page
**Good**: 10-15 key metrics (fits on one screen)

---

### 2. Update Regularly

**Bad**: Update dashboard once a quarter
**Good**: Update monthly (or weekly for fast-growing companies)

---

### 3. Show Trends, Not Just Snapshots

**Bad**: "MRR is $85K"
**Good**: "MRR is $85K, up 13% MoM (vs 10% last month)"

---

### 4. Use Color Coding

**Bad**: All numbers in black
**Good**: Green (good), yellow (caution), red (action needed)

---

### 5. Add Context

**Bad**: "LTV:CAC = 3.2:1"
**Good**: "LTV:CAC = 3.2:1 (target >3:1 ✅, benchmark 3-5:1 for SaaS)"

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Vanity Metrics

**Wrong**: "We have 10,000 users!" (but only 100 paying)
**Right**: Focus on revenue, not users

**Vanity metrics to avoid**:
- Total users (if free)
- Page views (if not monetized)
- Social media followers (if no conversion)

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Tracking Cohorts

**Wrong**: "Our churn is 4%" (total customer base)
**Right**: "Sep cohort: 3% churn, Oct cohort: 5% churn" (identify problem cohorts)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Leading Indicators

**Wrong**: Only track lagging indicators (revenue, churn)
**Right**: Also track leading indicators (pipeline, trial conversions, NPS)

**Example**:
- Lagging: Churn (tells you what happened)
- Leading: NPS (predicts future churn)

---

## Tools for Building Dashboards

### Google Sheets (Free)
**Pros**: Free, easy to share, good for <50 people
**Cons**: Manual updates, limited visualizations
**Best for**: Pre-seed to Seed

### ChartMogul ($100-500/mo)
**Pros**: Auto-sync with Stripe, SaaS metrics built-in, beautiful
**Cons**: $$, SaaS-only
**Best for**: Series A SaaS companies

### Metabase (Free/Self-Hosted)
**Pros**: Open-source, SQL access, customizable
**Cons**: Requires technical setup, self-hosting
**Best for**: Technical teams, Series A+

### Looker/Tableau ($$$)
**Pros**: Enterprise-grade, unlimited customization
**Cons**: $$$, complex setup
**Best for**: Series B+

```

**Runway**:
```
=CASH_IN_BANK / NET_BURN_RATE
```
