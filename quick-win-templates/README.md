## Template Categories Explained

### 📄 One-Page Templates

**What**: Strategic frameworks that fit on a single page
**Why**: Long documents don't get read; one-pagers force clarity
**When to use**: Planning meetings, decision-making, communication
**Time investment**: 15-60 minutes to complete
**Output**: Printed one-pager or shared doc

**Best practices**:
- Fill out in one sitting (don't overthink)
- Share with team immediately (no perfection required)
- Update quarterly or when assumptions change
- Use in meetings (project on screen, walk through)

---

### 📊 Comparison Guides

**What**: Side-by-side tool comparisons with recommendations
**Why**: Evaluating 10+ tools wastes weeks; we've done the research
**When to use**: Buying decisions for software/services
**Time investment**: 30-60 minutes to review and decide
**Output**: Decision on which tool to use

**Best practices**:
- Start with "Best For" column (find your use case)
- Check SEA-specific notes (pricing, support, integrations)
- Try 2-3 finalists with free trials
- Decide within 1 week (analysis paralysis is expensive)

**SEA-specific considerations included**:
- Multi-currency support (SGD, MYR, IDR, THB, VND, PHP)
- Local payment methods (GrabPay, GoPay, PayNow, PromptPay)
- SEA support hours (not just US timezones)
- Data residency requirements
- Local integrations (Xero SG, J&T Express, etc.)

---

### ✅ 30-Day Checklists

**What**: Step-by-step plans to launch initiatives in 30 days
**Why**: Projects without plans take 3x longer
**When to use**: Starting something new (product, program, market)
**Time investment**: 30 days of execution (15-30 min/day)
**Output**: Launched initiative

**Best practices**:
- Assign owner for each task
- Block 30 minutes/day for checklist work
- Don't skip steps (they're in order for a reason)
- Adjust timeline based on team size (solo = 45 days, team of 5 = 20 days)

**Checklist structure**:
- **Week 1**: Planning and setup
- **Week 2-3**: Execution
- **Week 4**: Testing and launch
- **Post-launch**: Measurement and iteration

---

### 🧮 Spreadsheet Calculators

**What**: Plug-and-play financial/operational models
**Why**: Building models from scratch takes days
**When to use**: Planning, forecasting, decision-making
**Time investment**: 15-30 minutes to input data
**Output**: Insights to drive decisions

**Best practices**:
- Use real data (not guesses)
- Update monthly (models are living documents)
- Scenario-plan (best case, worst case, likely case)
- Share with team (transparency builds trust)

**All calculators include**:
- Pre-built formulas (no Excel skills required)
- Example data (see how it works)
- Benchmarks (compare to industry standards)
- Charts/graphs (visualize insights)

## Who This Is For

### ✅ This library is perfect if you are:

- **Founder/CEO** at $2M-50M ARR company in SEA
- **Department head** (CFO, CMO, CTO, VP Sales) needing execution tools
- **Startup employee** (first 50 hires) tasked with "figuring it out"
- **Consultant/advisor** needing templates for clients
- **Time-constrained** (need results in hours, not weeks)

### ⚠️ This might not be for you if:

- **Enterprise (>500 employees)** - templates optimized for 10-100 person companies
- **B2C consumer products** - templates are B2B/SaaS focused
- **Pre-product/pre-revenue** - assumes you have product-market fit
- **Want custom/bespoke** - templates are standardized (not custom consulting)
