## Headcount Planning Formula

**Budget Available for Hiring** = (Revenue - COGS - OpEx) ÷ Team Size Target

**Example**:
- Revenue: $10M
- COGS: $2M (20%)
- OpEx (non-payroll): $2M (20%)
- Available for payroll: $6M (60%)
- Target team size: 50 people
- **Budget per employee**: $120K/year (fully loaded)

## Hiring Prioritization Framework

**Priority Matrix**:

| Role | Impact | Urgency | Difficulty | Priority |
|------|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Senior Backend Engineer** | High | High | High | P0 (hire now) |
| **Product Manager** | High | Medium | Medium | P1 (hire Q1) |
| **Sales Rep** | Medium | High | Low | P1 (hire Q1) |
| **Junior Engineer** | Medium | Medium | Low | P2 (hire Q2) |
| **Marketing Manager** | Medium | Low | Medium | P2 (hire Q2) |
| **Finance** | Low | Low | Low | P3 (hire Q3-Q4) |

**Priority Levels**:
- **P0**: Hire now (critical blocker)
- **P1**: Hire next quarter (important for growth)
- **P2**: Hire in 6 months (nice-to-have)
- **P3**: Hire in 12 months (can wait)

---

## Budget Constraints & Trade-Offs

### Scenario 1: Limited Budget (Cut 30%)

**Original Plan**: 38 hires, $3.8M
**Revised Plan**: 25 hires, $2.5M

**Cuts**:
- ❌ Reduce junior engineers from 4 → 2
- ❌ Reduce sales reps from 10 → 6
- ❌ Delay marketing hires (2 → 0)
- ❌ Delay G&A hires (4 → 2)

**Keep**:
- ✅ Senior engineers (8, critical for product)
- ✅ Product managers (2, critical for roadmap)
- ✅ Core sales team (6, needed for revenue)

**Impact**: Slower growth (target $8M ARR instead of $10M)

---

### Scenario 2: Aggressive Growth (Increase 50%)

**Original Plan**: 38 hires, $3.8M
**Revised Plan**: 57 hires, $5.7M

**Additions**:
- ✅ More senior engineers (8 → 12)
- ✅ More sales reps (10 → 15)
- ✅ More marketing (2 → 4)
- ✅ Customer success team (0 → 3)

**Funding Need**: Additional $2M (total $5.7M for payroll)

**Impact**: Faster growth (target $15M ARR), but higher burn

## Common Headcount Planning Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Ramp Time

**Wrong**: "We need 10 engineers by Q4" → Start hiring in Q3
**Right**: "We need 10 engineers productive by Q4" → Start hiring in Q1

**Why**: Hiring takes 3-4 months, ramp takes 2-3 months → 5-7 months total lead time

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Hiring Too Fast

**Wrong**: "Let's hire 50 people this quarter!"
**Right**: "Let's hire 10-15 people per quarter (sustainable)"

**Why**: Hiring too fast = poor quality, culture dilution, management chaos

**Rule of Thumb**: Don't grow faster than 50% per year (15 → 22 is okay, 15 → 50 is risky)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Attrition

**Wrong**: Assume 0% attrition
**Right**: Plan for 10-20% annual attrition

**Example**:
- Current: 15 people
- Target: 50 people
- Attrition: 15% (3 people leave)
- **Need to hire**: 38 (to reach 50) + 3 (to replace) = 41 total

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Accounting for Fully Loaded Cost

**Wrong**: "Engineer salary is $100K, so budget $100K"
**Right**: "Engineer salary is $100K, budget $130K (fully loaded)"

**Fully Loaded Cost** = Salary × 1.3
- Benefits: 15-20% (health insurance, retirement)
- Taxes: 7-10% (employer taxes)
- Office/Equipment: 3-5% (desk, laptop, monitors)

---

## Hiring Budget Breakdown

**Example**: Hiring 1 Senior Engineer (SGD 150K salary)

| Category | Cost | % of Salary |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Base Salary** | SGD 150K | 100% |
| **Benefits** (health, retirement) | SGD 25K | 17% |
| **Taxes** (employer portion) | SGD 12K | 8% |
| **Equipment** (laptop, monitors) | SGD 5K | 3% |
| **Office** (desk, space, utilities) | SGD 3K | 2% |
| **Recruiting** (20% of salary, one-time) | SGD 30K | 20% (Year 1 only) |
| **Total Year 1** | **SGD 225K** | **150%** |
| **Total Ongoing** | **SGD 195K** | **130%** |

**Planning Tip**: Budget 1.5x salary for Year 1 (includes recruiting), 1.3x for ongoing years

## Google Sheets Formula Reference

**Fully Loaded Cost**:
```
=SALARY * 1.3
```

**Revenue per Employee**:
```
=REVENUE / HEADCOUNT
```

**Quarterly Payroll**:
```
=SUMPRODUCT(HEADCOUNT_BY_ROLE, SALARY_BY_ROLE) * 1.3 / 4
```

**Headcount at End of Quarter**:
```
=STARTING_HEADCOUNT + NEW_HIRES - ATTRITION
```

**Hiring Budget Remaining**:
```
=TOTAL_BUDGET - CUMULATIVE_PAYROLL
```

## Hiring Plan Checklist

**Before Hiring**:
- [ ] Revenue plan clear (know how much we need to grow)
- [ ] Budget approved (cash available for payroll)
- [ ] Roles prioritized (P0, P1, P2)
- [ ] Job descriptions written (clear expectations)
- [ ] Hiring manager assigned (who owns this hire?)

**During Hiring**:
- [ ] Pipeline built (100+ candidates per role)
- [ ] Interviews scheduled (move fast, don't lose candidates)
- [ ] Offers extended (competitive, timely)
- [ ] Onboarding planned (first 30-60-90 days)

**After Hiring**:
- [ ] Track time to hire (reduce over time)
- [ ] Track time to productivity (reduce ramp time)
- [ ] Track quality of hire (performance reviews)
- [ ] Track retention (attrition rate)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Set revenue targets** (where do we want to be in 12 months?)
2. **Calculate budget** (how much can we spend on payroll?)
3. **Prioritize roles** (what roles are critical? P0, P1, P2)
4. **Build hiring plan** (quarter-by-quarter breakdown)
5. **Account for lead time** (start recruiting 3-4 months early)
6. **Track progress** (monthly review of hires vs plan)
7. **Adjust quarterly** (revise based on revenue, budget, attrition)
