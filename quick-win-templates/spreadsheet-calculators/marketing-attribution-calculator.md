## Marketing Attribution Basics

**What is attribution?**
Determining which marketing touchpoints contributed to a sale or conversion.

**Why it matters**:
- Optimize budget allocation (invest more in what works)
- Prove marketing ROI to executives
- Identify underperforming channels
- Understand customer journey

**Common problem**: Customer sees your ad on Facebook, clicks Google search, reads blog, then converts via email. Which channel gets credit?

---

## Attribution Models

### Model 1: Last-Touch Attribution (Simplest)

**Definition**: 100% credit to the last touchpoint before conversion

**Example**:
- Customer journey: Facebook Ad → Blog Post → Google Search → **Email** (converts)
- Email gets 100% credit for the sale

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to track
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Works well for short sales cycles

**Cons**:
- ❌ Ignores earlier touchpoints (awareness, consideration)
- ❌ Undervalues top-of-funnel activities
- ❌ Poor for multi-touch journeys (B2B)

**When to use**: E-commerce, short sales cycles (<7 days)

---

### Model 2: First-Touch Attribution

**Definition**: 100% credit to the first touchpoint

**Example**:
- Customer journey: **Facebook Ad** → Blog Post → Google Search → Email (converts)
- Facebook Ad gets 100% credit

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple to track
- ✅ Credits awareness activities
- ✅ Good for top-of-funnel optimization

**Cons**:
- ❌ Ignores nurture and closing activities
- ❌ Poor for long sales cycles

**When to use**: Brand awareness campaigns, top-of-funnel focus

---

### Model 3: Linear Attribution

**Definition**: Equal credit to all touchpoints

**Example**:
- Customer journey: Facebook Ad → Blog Post → Google Search → Email (converts)
- Each gets 25% credit (4 touchpoints)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fair to all channels
- ✅ Recognizes multi-touch journey
- ✅ Easy to calculate

**Cons**:
- ❌ Oversimplifies (not all touches are equal)
- ❌ Doesn't reflect real influence

**When to use**: When you want balanced view of all channels

---

### Model 4: Time-Decay Attribution

**Definition**: More recent touchpoints get more credit (exponential decay)

**Example**:
- Customer journey: Facebook Ad (20%) → Blog Post (25%) → Google Search (30%) → Email (25%)
- Email and Google Search get more credit (closer to conversion)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Reflects recency bias
- ✅ Credits closing activities more
- ✅ More realistic than linear

**Cons**:
- ❌ Still somewhat arbitrary
- ❌ Complex to calculate

**When to use**: Mid-length sales cycles (1-3 months)

---

### Model 5: U-Shaped (Position-Based) Attribution ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Definition**: 40% to first touch, 40% to last touch, 20% to middle touches

**Example**:
- Customer journey: Facebook Ad (40%) → Blog Post (10%) → Google Search (10%) → Email (40%)
- First and last get most credit, middle gets some

**Pros**:
- ✅ Balances awareness (first) and closing (last)
- ✅ Recognizes middle touches
- ✅ Most realistic for B2B

**Cons**:
- ❌ More complex to track
- ❌ Requires multi-touch tracking

**When to use**: B2B SaaS, long sales cycles (1-6 months)

## Setting Up Multi-Touch Tracking

### Step 1: Define Touchpoints

**List all marketing touchpoints**:
- Website visit (organic, paid, direct, referral)
- Blog post read
- Email opened/clicked
- Ad clicked (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)
- Webinar attended
- Demo booked
- Case study read

---

### Step 2: Implement Tracking

**Tools**:
- **Google Analytics 4**: Track website visits, UTM parameters
- **CRM** (HubSpot, Salesforce): Track email, calls, meetings
- **Marketing automation** (Marketo, Pardot): Track email engagement
- **Ad platforms**: Track ad clicks (Facebook Pixel, Google Ads)

**UTM Parameters** (for tracking links):
```
https://yoursite.com/page?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Q1-launch
```

- `utm_source`: facebook, google, linkedin, email
- `utm_medium`: cpc, email, social, referral
- `utm_campaign`: Q1-launch, product-demo, webinar

---

### Step 3: Connect Data Sources

**Centralize in one place** (CRM or data warehouse):
1. Import website visits (Google Analytics → CRM)
2. Import ad clicks (Facebook/Google → CRM)
3. Import email engagement (Email tool → CRM)
4. Link all to customer/lead records

**Example (HubSpot)**:
- Customer record shows: First visit (Google Ad) → Blog read → Email open → Demo booked (Webinar) → Closed (Email)

---

### Step 4: Calculate Attribution

**For each customer**:
1. List all touchpoints in chronological order
2. Apply attribution model (U-Shaped)
3. Assign credit to each channel
4. Sum up across all customers

**Example (U-Shaped)**:
- Customer journey: Google Ad → Blog → Email (close)
- Revenue: $5,000
- Attribution: Google ($2,000), Blog ($1,000), Email ($2,000)

## Advanced Attribution: Machine Learning

**Algorithmic attribution** (data-driven):
- Uses machine learning to assign credit based on actual impact
- Analyzes thousands of customer journeys
- Finds patterns in conversions vs non-conversions

**Tools**:
- Google Analytics 4 (Data-Driven Attribution)
- Adobe Analytics
- Custom models (Python: scikit-learn, Prophet)

**When to use**:
- Large dataset (1,000+ customers)
- Complex multi-touch journeys (5+ touchpoints)
- Want to optimize beyond simple models

**Example**: Machine learning finds that webinar attendees who also read a case study convert 3x higher → Assign more credit to that sequence

---

## Common Attribution Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Ignoring Dark Social

**Problem**: Customers discuss your product in Slack, WhatsApp, private channels (can't track)

**Solution**:
- Ask customers "How did you hear about us?" (qualitative)
- Use "Direct" as proxy for dark social
- Don't over-optimize based on trackable channels only

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Last-Touch Bias

**Problem**: Over-investing in closing channels (email, retargeting), under-investing in awareness (SEO, content)

**Solution**: Use U-Shaped or multi-touch model to credit awareness activities

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Updating Model

**Problem**: Using same attribution model as 2 years ago, but customer journey changed

**Solution**: Review model quarterly, adjust based on actual behavior

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Attribution ≠ Causation

**Problem**: Correlation doesn't mean causation (maybe email converts because customers are already ready to buy)

**Solution**:
- Run controlled experiments (A/B tests)
- Measure incrementality (what would happen without this channel?)

---

## Attribution by Company Stage

### Early-Stage (Pre-Seed, Seed)
- **Channels**: 1-3 (e.g., Google Ads, SEO, email)
- **Model**: Last-touch (simplicity > accuracy)
- **Focus**: Find what works, iterate fast

### Growth-Stage (Series A, B)
- **Channels**: 5-8 (ads, SEO, email, content, events, partnerships)
- **Model**: U-Shaped or Time-Decay
- **Focus**: Optimize budget allocation, prove ROI

### Scale-Stage (Series C+)
- **Channels**: 10+ (all channels, global markets)
- **Model**: Data-driven (ML-based)
- **Focus**: Incremental gains, efficiency at scale

## Google Sheets Formula Reference

**CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**:
```
=SPEND / CUSTOMERS
```

**ROI (Return on Investment)**:
```
=REVENUE / SPEND
```

**U-Shaped Attribution (First Touch)**:
```
=REVENUE * 0.40
```

**U-Shaped Attribution (Middle Touches)**:
```
=REVENUE * 0.20 / COUNT_OF_MIDDLE_TOUCHES
```

**U-Shaped Attribution (Last Touch)**:
```
=REVENUE * 0.40
```

**Conversion Rate (Stage to Stage)**:
```
=NEXT_STAGE / CURRENT_STAGE
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose attribution model** (recommend U-Shaped for B2B)
2. **Set up tracking** (UTM parameters, GA4, CRM integration)
3. **Collect 30-90 days of data** (need enough conversions)
4. **Build attribution spreadsheet** (Tab 1-4 above)
5. **Analyze results** (which channels over/under-performing?)
6. **Reallocate budget** (shift from low-ROI to high-ROI channels)
7. **Review monthly** (track changes in attribution over time)
