## Cloud Cost Optimization Formula

**Total Cloud Cost** = Compute + Storage + Data Transfer + Database + Other Services

**Optimization Potential** = (Current Cost - Optimized Cost) ÷ Current Cost × 100%

**Example**:
- Current monthly cost: $10,000
- Optimized cost (after rightsizing, reserved instances): $6,500
- **Savings**: $3,500/month (35% reduction)
- **Annual savings**: $42,000/year

## Cloud Cost Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Shut Down Non-Production Environments

**Savings**: 30-50% on dev/staging costs

**How**:
- [ ] Shut down dev/staging instances outside work hours (nights, weekends)
- [ ] Use Lambda to stop instances at 7pm, start at 8am (Mon-Fri)
- [ ] Snapshot databases before shutdown (for data persistence)

**Example Savings**:
- Dev environment: 10 instances × 168 hours/week → 50 hours/week (70% reduction)
- Monthly savings: $730/month × 70% = $511/month

---

### Strategy 2: Use Auto-Scaling

**Savings**: 20-40% on compute costs

**How**:
- [ ] Set up Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for web/api servers
- [ ] Scale down during low traffic (nights, weekends)
- [ ] Scale up during high traffic (peak hours, marketing campaigns)

**Example**:
- Current: 10 instances running 24/7
- Optimized: 4 instances baseline, scale to 10 during peak (12 hours/day)
- Average: 7 instances (30% reduction)
- Monthly savings: $730 × 30% = $219/month

---

### Strategy 3: Delete Unused Resources

**Savings**: 5-15% on total cloud spend

**Common Zombie Resources**:
- [ ] Unattached EBS volumes (orphaned after EC2 termination)
- [ ] Old snapshots (>90 days, no longer needed)
- [ ] Elastic IPs not associated with instances ($3.60/month each)
- [ ] Old AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
- [ ] Unused load balancers ($18/month each)

**How to Find**:
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor (free tier has basic recommendations)
- Run weekly script to identify unattached EBS, unused Elastic IPs
- Set up Lambda function to alert on unused resources

**Example Savings**:
- 20 unattached EBS volumes (500 GB total): $40/month
- 10 unused Elastic IPs: $36/month
- 2 unused load balancers: $36/month
- **Total**: $112/month ($1,344/year)

---

### Strategy 4: Use Savings Plans (AWS)

**Savings**: 30-60% on compute costs

**How**:
- [ ] Commit to $X/hour compute usage for 1-3 years
- [ ] Applies to EC2, Lambda, Fargate
- [ ] More flexible than Reserved Instances (any instance type, region)

**Example**:
- Current on-demand spend: $1,000/month
- 1-year Savings Plan: $700/month (30% off)
- 3-year Savings Plan: $600/month (40% off)
- **Savings**: $300-400/month

---

## Google Sheets Formula Reference

**Total Monthly Cost**:
```
=SUM(B2:B100)
```

**Savings Percentage**:
```
=(Current_Cost - Optimized_Cost) / Current_Cost
```

**Annual Savings**:
```
=Monthly_Savings * 12
```

**ROI ($ per hour)**:
```
=Annual_Savings / Implementation_Hours
```

**Cost per Instance**:
```
=Unit_Cost * Hours_per_Month
```

## Cloud Cost Optimization Checklist

**Before Optimization**:
- [ ] Download cost reports (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing)
- [ ] Identify top 10 most expensive services (80/20 rule)
- [ ] Review CloudWatch metrics (CPU, RAM, network utilization)
- [ ] List all Reserved Instances (check expiration dates)
- [ ] Audit IAM permissions (who has access to provision resources?)

**During Optimization**:
- [ ] Rightsize over-provisioned instances (downsize)
- [ ] Purchase Reserved Instances for steady-state workloads (1-3 year)
- [ ] Migrate batch jobs to Spot Instances (70% discount)
- [ ] Move old data to cheaper storage (S3 Glacier, Infrequent Access)
- [ ] Optimize databases (downsize, switch to on-demand, remove Multi-AZ in dev)
- [ ] Set up CloudFront CDN (reduce data transfer costs)

**After Optimization**:
- [ ] Monitor costs weekly (set alerts)
- [ ] Review monthly (check for new optimization opportunities)
- [ ] Quarterly Reserved Instance review (renew expiring RIs)
- [ ] Annual architecture review (new instance types, cheaper alternatives)

## Common Cloud Cost Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Running Production-Sized Dev Environments

**Wrong**: Dev/staging = same size as production (identical costs)
**Right**: Dev/staging = 30-50% of production size (right-sized)

**Why**: Dev doesn't need HA, Multi-AZ, large instances. Save 50-70% on dev costs.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Using Reserved Instances

**Wrong**: Pay on-demand for 24/7 workloads (100% cost)
**Right**: Use Reserved Instances for production (30-60% savings)

**Why**: Reserved Instances pay for themselves in 9-18 months.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring Data Transfer Costs

**Wrong**: Don't monitor data transfer (hidden cost explosion)
**Right**: Use CloudFront CDN, minimize cross-region traffic

**Why**: Data transfer = 10-30% of cloud bill. Easy to optimize with CDN.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Auto-Scaling

**Wrong**: Fixed number of instances (over-provisioned for peak)
**Right**: Auto-scale based on traffic (scale down during low traffic)

**Why**: Auto-scaling saves 20-40% on compute costs.
