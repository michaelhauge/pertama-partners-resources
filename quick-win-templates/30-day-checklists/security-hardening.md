# Security Hardening (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Secure infrastructure and applications against common attacks
**Time Investment**: 30-40 hours over 30 days
**Team Size**: 1-2 people (CTO, DevOps, security engineer)
**Output**: Hardened infrastructure, security policies, incident response plan

---

## Security Hardening Strategy

**Why Security Matters**:
- **Data breaches = customer trust lost**: Average breach costs $4M+ (IBM 2025)
- **Compliance requirements**: GDPR, PDPA, SOC 2, ISO 27001
- **Ransomware attacks**: Growing in SEA ($100K-$1M+ ransom demands)
- **Customer requirements**: B2B customers demand security audits

**Reality Check**:
- Perfect security doesn't exist (defense in depth)
- Security is ongoing (not one-time project)
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort wins first (80/20 rule)

---

## Week 1: Assessment & Quick Wins (Days 1-7)

**Theme**: Identify vulnerabilities, fix low-hanging fruit

### Day 1-2: Security Audit

#### 2. Update Vulnerable Dependencies
```bash
# Node.js
npm audit fix --force

# Python
pip-audit --fix

# Ruby
bundle audit check --update
```

#### 3. Close Unnecessary Open Ports
- [ ] Review open ports: `nmap -p- yourdomain.com`
- [ ] Close ports not in use (SSH 22, MySQL 3306, PostgreSQL 5432 should NOT be public)
- [ ] Use security groups (AWS) or firewall rules (GCP, DigitalOcean)

#### 4. Enable HTTPS Everywhere
- [ ] Use Let's Encrypt (free SSL certificates)

---

### Day 12-13: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Define Roles**:
- [ ] **Admin**: Full access (founders, CTO)
- [ ] **Developer**: Read/write code, read logs, no production deploy
- [ ] **Support**: Read customer data, no write access
- [ ] **Finance**: Read billing, no infrastructure access

**Implement RBAC in Application**:
```javascript
// Example: Express.js middleware
function requireRole(role) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user || !req.user.roles.includes(role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
    }
    next();
  };
}

// Usage
app.post('/admin/users', requireRole('admin'), createUser);
app.get('/reports', requireRole('finance'), getReports);
```

- [ ] Run containers as non-root user (`USER node` in Dockerfile)
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Snyk)
- [ ] Limit container resources (CPU, memory)
- [ ] Use read-only filesystems where possible
- [ ] Update base images regularly (alpine, node, python)

**Deliverable**: Servers hardened, SSH secured, Docker containers secured

---

### Day 19-20: Network Security

- [ ] Sanitize inputs (prevent XSS): use libraries (DOMPurify, bleach)
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- [ ] Whitelist allowed characters (don't rely on blacklist)

**Example (SQL Injection Prevention)**:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: String concatenation (vulnerable to SQL injection)
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

// ✅ RIGHT: Parameterized query (safe)
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
db.query(query, [email]);
```

**Output Encoding**:
- [ ] Encode HTML output (prevent XSS)
- [ ] Set Content-Security-Policy header (block inline scripts)
- [ ] Set X-Frame-Options header (prevent clickjacking)
- [ ] Set X-Content-Type-Options header (prevent MIME sniffing)

**CSRF Protection**:
- [ ] Use CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Set SameSite cookie attribute (`SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict`)
- [ ] Verify Origin/Referer headers

**Deliverable**: Application secured (input validation, CSRF, XSS prevention)

---

### Day 25-26: Secrets Management

**Move Secrets to Secret Manager**:
- [ ] Use AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault
- [ ] Never commit secrets to git (add .env to .gitignore)
- [ ] Rotate secrets regularly (quarterly for API keys, annually for passwords)
- [ ] Use different secrets for dev, staging, production

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk-abc123xyz789';

# ✅ RIGHT: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

**Audit Secrets Usage**:
- [ ] List all secrets (API keys, database passwords, tokens)
- [ ] Document who has access to each secret
- [ ] Revoke unused secrets
- [ ] Set up alerts for secret access (CloudTrail, Vault audit logs)

**Deliverable**: Secrets moved to secret manager, rotation policy defined

---

### Day 27-28: Incident Response Plan

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Hardcoding Secrets

**Wrong**: `const apiKey = 'sk-abc123xyz789';`
**Right**: `const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;`

**Why**: Hardcoded secrets → git history → data breach

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Allowing Public Database Access

**Wrong**: PostgreSQL listens on 0.0.0.0:5432 (public)
**Right**: PostgreSQL listens on 127.0.0.1:5432 (localhost only)

**Why**: Public database → brute force attacks → breach

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Updating Dependencies

**Wrong**: Never run `npm audit` or `pip-audit`
**Right**: Run weekly, fix critical vulnerabilities immediately

**Why**: Vulnerable dependencies → known exploits → breach

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Backup Strategy

**Wrong**: No database backups
**Right**: Automated daily backups, stored off-site, encrypted

**Why**: Ransomware attack → data loss → business failure

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run security audit** (OWASP ZAP, npm audit, Nmap)
2. **Fix critical issues** (secrets, open ports, vulnerable dependencies)
3. **Enable MFA** (AWS, GitHub, Google Workspace)
4. **Implement RBAC** (define roles, enforce least privilege)
5. **Harden infrastructure** (firewalls, SSH, database security)
6. **Secure application** (input validation, CSRF, XSS prevention)
7. **Create incident response plan** (playbooks, team roles)
8. **Train team** (phishing, password hygiene, secure coding)
9. **Monitor continuously** (logs, alerts, quarterly scans)
