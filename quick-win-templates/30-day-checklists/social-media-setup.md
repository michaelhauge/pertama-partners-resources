## Social Media Strategy

**Why Social Media?**
- **Brand awareness**: Reach potential customers where they already are
- **Thought leadership**: Share insights, build credibility
- **Customer support**: Answer questions, engage with customers
- **Hiring**: Attract talent, showcase culture
- **SEO**: Social signals help search rankings

**Reality Check**:
- Social media ≠ instant sales (long-term brand building)
- Requires consistency (3-5 posts/week minimum)
- Takes 6-12 months to see real ROI

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Inconsistent Posting

**Wrong**: Post 10x one week, then ghost for 3 weeks
**Right**: Post 3-5x/week consistently

**Why**: Algorithm favors consistency. Followers forget you if you disappear.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Promotional Content

**Wrong**: Every post is "Buy our product!"
**Right**: 80% value, 20% promotion (80/20 rule)

**Why**: Nobody follows brands for ads. Provide value first.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Engagement

**Wrong**: Post and ghost (never reply to comments)
**Right**: Reply within 2 hours (show you're listening)

**Why**: Social media = conversation, not broadcast.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Buying Followers

**Wrong**: Pay for 10,000 fake followers
**Right**: Grow organically (slow but real)

**Why**: Fake followers = low engagement = algorithm penalizes you.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose platforms** (1-2 platforms, don't spread thin)
2. **Set up profiles** (logo, bio, URL)
3. **Define content pillars** (3-5 topics)
4. **Create 2 weeks of content** (schedule in advance)
5. **Engage daily** (15-30 min: comment, like, reply)
6. **Track metrics** (engagement rate, follower growth)
7. **Iterate monthly** (double down on what works)
