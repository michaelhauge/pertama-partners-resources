# Fundraising Prep (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Prepare to raise capital (seed to Series B) in 30 days
**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours/day for founder + team support
**Team Size**: Founder + CFO/Finance + 1-2 key team members
**Output**: Pitch deck, financial model, data room, investor list ready

---

## Overview

This checklist prepares you to START fundraising (not close it). Fundraising typically takes 2-4 months AFTER prep:

- **Days 1-30**: Prep (this checklist)
- **Months 1-4**: Fundraising (pitching, meetings, due diligence, term sheet, close)

**Do NOT skip prep**. Raising money without preparation wastes your time and damages your reputation with investors.

---

## Pre-Prep (Do This First)

Before starting this 30-day sprint, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Product-market fit** (customers paying, retention >60%)
- [ ] **Growth story** (revenue/users growing month-over-month)
- [ ] **Runway to 6+ months** (don't fundraise when you're desperate)
- [ ] **Clear use of funds** (what will you do with the money?)
- [ ] **Founder aligned** (co-founders on same page about dilution, terms)

**If you don't have these, focus on product/growth first. Don't fundraise.**

---

## Week 1: Strategy & Positioning (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Define Fundraising Goals

**Owner**: Founder/CEO
**Time**: 2-3 hours

- [ ] How much to raise? $[X]M
  - Rule of thumb: 18-24 months of runway
  - Example: $150K/month burn × 20 months = $3M raise
- [ ] What round? (Seed, Series A, Series B)
- [ ] Target valuation? $[X]M (or cap if using SAFE)
  - Seed: $2M-10M
  - Series A: $10M-50M
  - Series B: $50M-200M
- [ ] How much dilution? (Aim for 15-25% per round)
- [ ] Who leads? (Do you need a lead investor?)

  - [ ] Sector (do they invest in your industry?)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Fundraising with <3 Months Runway

**Problem**: Desperation shows, investors smell it
**Fix**: Fundraise when you have 6+ months runway (18 months is ideal)

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Talking to Investors Without Warm Intro

**Problem**: Cold emails have <5% response rate
**Fix**: Always get warm intro (80% of successful raises come from warm intros)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Traction Story

**Problem**: "We're pre-revenue but have a great idea"
**Fix**: Get SOME traction first (10 paying customers, 1K users, $10K MRR - something)

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Unclear Use of Funds

**Problem**: "We'll use the money to grow"
**Fix**: Specific milestones - "Hire 3 engineers, launch v2, scale ads to $50K/mo, reach $5M ARR in 18 months"

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Over-Optimistic Financial Projections

**Problem**: "We'll 10x revenue every year for 5 years"
**Fix**: Conservative is better (3x annual growth for Series A, 2x for Series B)

---

## Red Flags Investors Look For

- ❌ Founder conflict (co-founders not aligned)
- ❌ No focus (doing too many things)
- ❌ High churn (>10% monthly)
- ❌ Weak unit economics (LTV:CAC < 3:1)
- ❌ Slow growth (flat MoM)
- ❌ Vague answers (not knowing your numbers)
- ❌ Blaming others (past failures were "not my fault")

**Fix these BEFORE fundraising**

---

## Tools & Resources

**Investor research**:
- Crunchbase (investor database)
- Signal (find warm intros)
- Harmonic (fundraising CRM)

**Pitch deck**:

## Next Steps

1. **Ensure you meet pre-reqs** (PMF, growth, runway)
2. **Start Day 1** (define fundraising goals)
3. **Work through Week 1-4** (30 days of prep)
4. **Begin fundraising** (Months 2-4)
5. **Close round** (Month 5)

**Remember**: Fundraising is a marathon, not a sprint. 5 months is normal. 12 months is not uncommon. Budget time accordingly.
