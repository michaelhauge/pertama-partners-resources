# Partner Program Launch (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Build partner/affiliate program to drive referrals
**Time Investment**: 25-35 hours over 30 days
**Team Size**: 1-2 people (founder, partnerships lead, marketer)
**Output**: Partner program with recruiting, onboarding, commission structure, first 10-20 partners

---

## Partner Program Strategy

**Why Partner Programs?**:
- **Scale distribution**: Partners sell for you (leverage their network)
- **Lower CAC**: Pay commission only on closed deals (performance-based)
- **Build ecosystem**: Partners integrate, resell, refer
- **Credibility**: Partner brands boost your credibility

**Reality Check**:
- Partner programs take time (3-6 months to see meaningful revenue)
- Requires ongoing support (partner onboarding, training, enablement)
- Not all partners are created equal (80/20 rule: 20% drive 80% of deals)

---

## Week 1: Program Design & Structure (Days 1-7)

**Theme**: Define program model, commission structure

### Day 1-2: Choose Partner Program Type

**Types of Partner Programs**:

**1. Affiliate Program** (Referrals)
- **What**: Partners refer leads, earn commission when they close
- **Best for**: B2C, low-touch sales, consumer products
- **Commission**: 10-30% of first year revenue (recurring or one-time)
- **Example**: Shopify Partners, Amazon Associates

**2. Reseller Program** (Indirect Sales)
- **What**: Partners sell your product under their brand or yours
- **Best for**: B2B, complex sales, enterprise
- **Commission**: 20-40% of deal value
- **Example**: AWS Partner Network, Microsoft Solution Partners

**3. Referral Program** (Lead Sharing)
- **What**: Partners introduce you to prospects, you close
- **Best for**: B2B, consultative sales, high ACV
- **Commission**: 10-20% of first year revenue (one-time)
- **Example**: HubSpot Partner Program, Salesforce AppExchange

**4. Technology/Integration Partners**
- **What**: Partners build integrations, co-market
- **Best for**: SaaS platforms, APIs, developer tools
- **Commission**: Often no commission (mutual marketing benefit)
- **Example**: Slack App Directory, Stripe Partners

**Decision Framework**:

| Scenario | Recommended Type |
|----------|------------------|
| **B2C product, self-serve** | Affiliate Program |
| **B2B SaaS, sales-led** | Referral or Reseller Program |
| **API/Platform** | Technology Partners |
| **Low ACV (<$1K)** | Affiliate Program |
| **High ACV (>$10K)** | Reseller or Referral Program |

**Deliverable**: Partner program type selected

### Day 3-4: Design Commission Structure

**Commission Models**:

**1. Recurring Commission** (Best for SaaS):
- **Structure**: % of MRR for lifetime of customer
- **Example**: 20% of MRR for 12 months
- **Pros**: Incentivizes quality customers (partner cares about retention)
- **Cons**: Accounting complexity, payouts over time

**2. One-Time Commission**:
- **Structure**: % of first year revenue or flat fee
- **Example**: $500 per customer or 20% of first year
- **Pros**: Simple, pay once
- **Cons**: Partner doesn't care about retention

**3. Tiered Commission** (Reward Top Performers):
- **Structure**: Commission increases with volume
- **Example**:
  - 0-5 customers/month: 15% commission
  - 6-10 customers/month: 20% commission
  - 11+ customers/month: 25% commission
- **Pros**: Motivates partners to scale
- **Cons**: More complex

**Commission Rate Benchmarks** (SaaS):
- **Affiliates (referrals only)**: 10-30% of first year
- **Resellers (sell directly)**: 20-40% of deal value
- **Referral partners (introduce, you close)**: 10-20% of first year
- **Technology partners**: 0% (mutual benefit)

**Example Commission Structure** (Referral Program):
- **Commission**: 20% of first year ARR
- **Payment**: Within 30 days of customer's first payment
- **Clawback**: If customer churns within 90 days, commission is clawed back
- **Minimum payout**: $100 (avoid paying $5 commissions)

**Deliverable**: Commission structure defined

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Commission Too Low

**Wrong**: 5% commission (partners ignore you)
**Right**: 20-30% commission (motivates partners)

**Why**: Partners have options. Low commission = not worth their time.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: No Partner Support

**Wrong**: Recruit partners, then ghost them
**Right**: Monthly check-ins, training, resources

**Why**: Partners need enablement. Treat them like sales team.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Unclear Attribution

**Wrong**: Customer says "I heard about you from Partner X" (maybe they did, maybe they didn't)
**Right**: Use tracking links with 90-day cookie attribution

**Why**: Clear attribution = trust. Partners won't refer if they don't get credit.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Partner Tiers

**Wrong**: Treat all partners the same (one-size-fits-all)
**Right**: Tier partners (Tier 1 gets white-glove service, Tier 3 self-serve)

**Why**: 80/20 rule. Focus on top 20% who drive 80% of revenue.
