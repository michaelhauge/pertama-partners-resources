## Common Market Entry Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Ignoring Payment Methods

**Wrong**: "We accept credit cards, that's enough"
**Right**: "We accept e-wallets (GoPay, GCash), bank transfer, OTC"

**Why**: Only 10-30% of SEA has credit cards. Must support local payment methods.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Localizing Pricing

**Wrong**: Charging $50/month in Philippines (where GDP per capita is $3.5K)
**Right**: Charging $5-15/month (adjusted for purchasing power)

**Why**: $50 = 2% of monthly income in Philippines vs 0.1% in US. Not affordable.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Going Alone (No Local Partner)

**Wrong**: "We'll figure out the local market ourselves"
**Right**: "We'll partner with local reseller/distributor who knows the market"

**Why**: Local partner = faster regulatory approval, distribution, trust

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Expecting Fast ROI

**Wrong**: "We'll be profitable in 3 months"
**Right**: "We'll break even in 12-18 months"

**Why**: Market entry = upfront investment (localization, marketing, hiring). Takes time to recover.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose target market** (largest opportunity, least barriers)
2. **Conduct Week 1 research** (market size, competition, regulations)
3. **Localize product** (language, currency, payments)
4. **Launch marketing** (ads, PR, outreach)
5. **Close first customers** (3-5 in first 30 days)
6. **Iterate based on feedback** (improve product, pricing, messaging)
7. **Scale** (hire local team, increase marketing, expand to adjacent markets)
