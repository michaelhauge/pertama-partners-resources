# Content Marketing Launch (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Launch content marketing program from scratch

**Team Size**: 1-2 people (founder, marketer, content writer)
**Output**: Content strategy, published content, distribution plan, first traffic

---

## Content Marketing Strategy

**Why Content Marketing?**:
- **SEO**: Blog posts rank on Google, drive organic traffic
- **Thought leadership**: Establish expertise, build trust
- **Lead generation**: Content → email signups → sales pipeline
- **Customer education**: Reduce support load, improve retention
- **Long-term ROI**: Content compounds (traffic grows over time)

**Reality Check**:
- Content marketing is slow (3-6 months to see results)
- Requires consistency (2-4 posts/month minimum)
- Quality > quantity (1 great post > 10 mediocre posts)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Writing for Everyone

**Wrong**: "This post is for founders, marketers, engineers, support teams, and investors"
**Right**: "This post is for Series A founders struggling with churn"

**Why**: Specific = resonates. Generic = ignored.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: No CTA (Call-to-Action)

**Wrong**: Post ends with "Thanks for reading!"
**Right**: Post ends with "Download our churn reduction playbook: [Link]"

**Why**: No CTA = no conversion. Every post should drive action.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Publishing and Ghosting

**Wrong**: Publish post, never promote
**Right**: Publish post, promote for 7 days (social, email, communities)

**Why**: 80% of traffic comes from promotion, not organic search (in Month 1-3)

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Prioritizing Quantity Over Quality

**Wrong**: Publish 20 posts/month (500 words, no research)
**Right**: Publish 4 posts/month (2,000 words, well-researched)

**Why**: Google rewards quality. 1 great post > 10 mediocre posts.
