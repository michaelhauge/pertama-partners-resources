## Pre-Launch (Do This First)

Before starting this 30-day sprint, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Team assigned** (PM, 2-3 engineers, designer, marketer)

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Scope Creep

**Problem**: "Can we just add one more thing?" on Day 15
**Impact**: Launch delayed, team stressed, quality suffers
**Fix**: Lock scope on Day 1. New ideas go in v2.

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: No Beta Testing

**Problem**: Ship to everyone on Day 29 without beta
**Impact**: Critical bugs in production, angry customers
**Fix**: Always beta test (Days 19-21) before full launch

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Marketing as Afterthought

**Problem**: "We'll figure out marketing after we ship"
**Impact**: Product launches, no one knows, no usage
**Fix**: Start marketing prep on Day 4 (not Day 25)

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: No Monitoring

**Problem**: Ship product, don't track metrics
**Impact**: Don't know if launch succeeded or failed
**Fix**: Set up analytics on Day 6, monitor daily

---

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Ignoring Feedback

**Problem**: Customers complain, team ignores
**Impact**: Product dies, customers churn
**Fix**: Respond to feedback within 24 hours, fix top issues in v1.1

---

## Tools & Templates

- **Jira** (enterprise)
- **Asana** (non-technical teams)

## Next Steps

1. **Customize this checklist** for your product (add/remove items)
2. **Assign owners** (who owns what)
3. **Set up daily standups** (15 min at 10am)
4. **Start Day 1** (kickoff meeting)
5. **Ship on Day 30** (no matter what - cut scope if needed)

**Remember**: Done is better than perfect. Ship v1, learn, ship v1.1.
