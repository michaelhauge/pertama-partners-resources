# Customer Success Program (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Launch customer success program to improve retention and expansion
**Time Investment**: 20-30 hours over 30 days
**Team Size**: 1 CS lead + 1-2 team members
**Output**: CS playbook, customer health scores, expansion pipeline

---

## Why Customer Success Matters

**The Retention Problem**:
- Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retaining existing ones
- 5% increase in retention = 25-95% increase in profits
- For SaaS: Churn is the #1 killer of growth

**Customer Success (CS) solves**:
- **Churn**: Keep customers longer (retention)
- **Expansion**: Upsell and cross-sell (NRR >100%)
- **Advocacy**: Turn customers into promoters (referrals, case studies)

**ROI of CS**:
- **Good CS**: Churn <5%, NRR 110-120%
- **Bad CS**: Churn >10%, NRR 80-90%

---

## Customer Success vs Support

**Customer Support** (Reactive):
- Responds to tickets
- Fixes problems
- Measured by: Response time, CSAT

**Customer Success** (Proactive):
- Prevents problems before they happen
- Drives adoption, retention, expansion
- Measured by: Churn, NRR, product usage

**Example**:
- **Support**: Customer emails "How do I export data?" → Answer ticket
- **Success**: Notice customer hasn't exported data in 30 days → Proactively reach out, show how, identify why they stopped

---

## Week 1: Foundation & Planning (Days 1-7)

**Theme**: Define CS strategy and customer segments

### Day 1-2: Define Customer Success Goals

**Goals to set**:
- [ ] **Churn target**: <5% monthly churn (SaaS standard)
- [ ] **NRR target**: 100-120% (net revenue retention)
- [ ] **Expansion target**: 20-30% of customers expand (upsell/cross-sell)
- [ ] **Health score target**: 80%+ of customers "green" (healthy)
- [ ] **Product adoption**: 60%+ weekly active users (WAU)

**Example (B2B SaaS)**:
- Starting churn: 8% (too high)
- Target churn: <5% (reduce by 3%)
- Starting NRR: 95% (losing revenue)
- Target NRR: 110% (expansion offsets churn)

**Deliverable**: CS goals document with targets and timelines

---

### Day 3-4: Segment Your Customers

**Why segment?**
Not all customers are equal. Tailor CS approach by segment.

**Segmentation criteria**:
1. **Revenue** (high-value vs low-value)
2. **Product usage** (power users vs inactive)
3. **Risk** (at-risk vs healthy)
4. **Expansion potential** (upsell opportunity)

**Example Segmentation**:

| Segment | Definition | Count | % of Revenue | CS Approach |
|---------|------------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Enterprise** | >$50K ARR | 20 | 60% | 1:1 CSM, quarterly reviews |
| **Mid-Market** | $10K-50K ARR | 80 | 30% | 1:many CSM, webinars |
| **SMB** | <$10K ARR | 200 | 10% | Self-service, automated emails |
| **At-Risk** | Low usage, overdue | 30 | 5% | Urgent intervention |

**Deliverable**: Customer segments with CS strategy per segment

---

### Day 5-6: Build Customer Health Score

**Health Score = Measure of customer health (0-100)**

**Components** (weighted):
1. **Product Usage** (40%): Are they using the product regularly?
2. **Engagement** (30%): Are they opening emails, attending webinars, responding to outreach?
3. **Support Tickets** (20%): Are they filing many support tickets (frustrated)?
4. **Commercial** (10%): Are they paying on time? Expanding?

**Example Calculation**:

| Metric | Weight | Score (0-100) | Weighted Score |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Product Usage** (daily active users) | 40% | 80 (8/10 users active) | 32 |
| **Engagement** (email open rate) | 30% | 60 (3/5 emails opened) | 18 |
| **Support Tickets** (low is good) | 20% | 70 (2 tickets last month) | 14 |
| **Commercial** (payment on time) | 10% | 100 (paid on time) | 10 |
| **Health Score** | - | - | **74 (Yellow)** |

**Health Categories**:
- **Green** (80-100): Healthy, expansion opportunity
- **Yellow** (60-79): At-risk, needs attention
- **Red** (<60): Critical, high churn risk

**Deliverable**: Health score spreadsheet for all customers
