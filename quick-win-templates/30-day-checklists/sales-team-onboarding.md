# Sales Team Onboarding (30 Days)

**Purpose**: Ramp new sales reps to productivity in 30 days
**Time Investment**: 20-30 hours (rep time), 5-10 hours (manager time)
**Team Size**: Sales rep + sales manager + 1-2 mentors
**Output**: Fully ramped rep making first sales by end of month 1

---

## Onboarding Philosophy

**Goal**: Get reps closing deals within 30-45 days (not 90+)

**Key Principles**:
1. **Learn by doing**: Shadowing → Practice → Real calls (Week 1-4)
2. **Product first**: Reps must deeply understand product before selling
3. **Customer empathy**: Listen to customer calls, read support tickets
4. **Gradual ramp**: Demo calls (Week 2) → Discovery (Week 3) → Full cycle (Week 4)

## Common Onboarding Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Much Classroom, Not Enough Practice

**Wrong**: 2-3 weeks of training before first call
**Right**: 1 week training, then shadow + practice + real calls

**Why**: Reps learn by doing, not reading. Get them on calls ASAP.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: No Shadowing or Role-Playing

**Wrong**: "Read this doc, now go make calls"
**Right**: Shadow 10-15 calls, role-play 10+ times before solo calls

**Why**: Reps need to see how it's done and practice in safe environment.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Clear Milestones

**Wrong**: "Just learn as much as you can"
**Right**: Specific milestones each week (demo cert, first call, first close)

**Why**: Clear milestones create accountability and urgency.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Manager Not Involved

**Wrong**: "Figure it out yourself" or "Just shadow the team"
**Right**: Manager on every call in Week 3, daily feedback, weekly 1:1

**Why**: Manager coaching is #1 driver of rep success.
