# Customer Support Platforms (Comparison Guide)

**Purpose**: Choose customer support software for helpdesk, tickets, live chat
**Time to Complete**: 2-3 hours (research + setup)
**Use Case**: Founders, support managers choosing support platform
**Output**: Platform recommendation with implementation plan

---

## Why Customer Support Platforms Matter

**Support = retention**:
- Fast response → happy customers → lower churn
- Organized tickets → nothing falls through cracks
- Self-service → customers help themselves (less support load)

**Without platform = chaos**:
- Support via personal email (lost messages)
- No tracking (who handled what?)
- Slow response (no SLAs, no automation)
- No metrics (response time, resolution time unknown)

**With platform = scale**:
- Shared inbox (whole team sees tickets)
- Automation (routing, canned responses, SLAs)
- Self-service (knowledge base, help center)
- Metrics (track everything)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Choosing Based on Features Alone

**Wrong**: "Zendesk has the most features, let's use it"
**Right**: "We only need email + chat, Help Scout is perfect"

**Why**: More features = more complexity = slower adoption

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Setting Up Automation

**Wrong**: Manually assign every ticket
**Right**: Auto-assign based on tags, priority, agent availability

**Why**: Automation saves 5-10 hours/week per agent

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Knowledge Base

**Wrong**: Answer same questions 100x via chat/email
**Right**: Create knowledge base with top 20 FAQs, link in responses

**Why**: Self-service reduces support volume by 20-40%

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Tracking Metrics

**Wrong**: No idea how long it takes to respond to tickets
**Right**: Track response time, resolution time, CSAT (customer satisfaction)

**Why**: Can't improve what you don't measure

---

## Support Metrics to Track

**Response Time**:
- **First response time**: Time from ticket creation → first agent response
- **Target**: <2 hours (B2B), <1 hour (B2C)

**Resolution Time**:
- **Time to resolve**: Time from ticket creation → ticket closed
- **Target**: <24 hours (simple), <72 hours (complex)

**Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**:
- **Rating**: 1-5 stars after ticket is resolved
- **Target**: 4.5+ stars (90%+ satisfaction)

**Ticket Volume**:
- **Tickets per day**: How many new tickets?
- **Target**: <50 tickets per agent per day

**First Contact Resolution (FCR)**:
- **% resolved in first response**: No back-and-forth needed
- **Target**: 70%+ (well-documented, clear responses)

---

## SEA-Specific Considerations

### Time Zones

**Challenge**: SEA spans multiple time zones (GMT+7 to GMT+8)

**Solution**:
- Set support hours (9am-6pm SGT)
- Use automation for after-hours (auto-response, chatbot)
- Consider 24/7 support if global customers

---

### Languages

**Challenge**: Customers speak English, Bahasa Indonesia, Malay, Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog

**Solution**:
- Hire multilingual agents (English + local language)
- Use translation tools (Google Translate API)
- Create knowledge base in multiple languages

---

### Payment Methods

**Challenge**: Platforms charge in USD, SEA businesses pay in SGD/MYR/IDR

**Solution**:
- Use credit card (auto-convert to local currency)
- Consider SEA alternatives (e.g., Trengo for SEA-focused support)

---

## Integration Ecosystem

**Key Integrations** (for all platforms):

| Category | Tools | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Team chat** | Slack, Microsoft Teams | Notify team of new tickets |
| **CRM** | Salesforce, HubSpot | Link tickets to customer records |
| **E-commerce** | Shopify, WooCommerce | View order details in tickets |
| **Payments** | Stripe, PayPal | Refund from support dashboard |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics, Mixpanel | Track support impact on retention |
| **Dev tools** | Jira, Linear, GitHub | Link tickets to bugs/features |

---

## Canned Responses (Templates)

**Use canned responses to save time on common questions**

### Example: Password Reset

**Trigger**: Customer says "forgot password"

**Response**:
"Hi [First Name],

No problem! You can reset your password here: [Link]

If you don't receive the email within 5 minutes, check your spam folder or reply to this email.

Best,
[Agent Name]"

**Time Saved**: 2 minutes per ticket × 50 tickets/day = 100 minutes/day

---

### Example: Feature Request

**Trigger**: Customer asks for new feature

**Response**:
"Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the suggestion! We're not building [Feature] right now, but I've added your request to our roadmap.

We'll email you if we decide to build it. In the meantime, here's a workaround: [Link]

Best,
[Agent Name]"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Identify support channels** (email, chat, phone, social?)
2. **Set budget** ($0-100/agent/month)
3. **Choose platform** (Intercom, Zendesk, Freshdesk, Help Scout, Linear, Crisp)
4. **Sign up for free trial** (14-30 days)
5. **Forward support email** (support@company.com)
6. **Install chat widget** (if live chat)
7. **Create canned responses** (top 10 questions)
8. **Set up automation** (assignment, routing)
9. **Create knowledge base** (top 20 FAQs)
10. **Train team** (1-2 hours)
