## Common Issues

### Issue 1: KYC Rejection

**Problem**: Gateway rejects your business registration
**Causes**:
- Missing documents
- Business address doesn't match
- High-risk industry (crypto, gambling, adult)

**Fix**:
- Re-submit with correct documents
- Use registered business address
- Provide additional docs (website screenshots, product demo)

---

### Issue 2: High Chargeback Rate

**Problem**: Gateway flags your account for high chargebacks (>1%)
**Causes**:
- Poor customer service (customers dispute instead of requesting refund)
- Vague product descriptions (customer doesn't recognize charge)
- Subscription without clear cancellation flow

**Fix**:
- Make refunds easy (don't force customers to chargeback)
- Use clear business name on credit card statement
- Send email confirmation immediately after charge
- Implement clear cancellation flow

---

### Issue 3: Slow Payouts

**Problem**: Money takes 7-14 days to reach your bank
**Typical timeline**:
- T+2 to T+7 days (most gateways)
- Longer for first few payouts (risk management)

**Fix**:
- Choose gateway with fast payouts (Midtrans: 2-3 days)
- Get verified (complete KYC fully)
- Build transaction history (payouts speed up over time)

---
