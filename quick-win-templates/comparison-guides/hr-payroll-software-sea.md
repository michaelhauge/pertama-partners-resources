# HR/Payroll Software for SEA (Comparison Guide)

**Purpose**: Choose HR and payroll software for SEA compliance
**Time to Complete**: 3-4 hours (research + setup)
**Use Case**: Founders, HR managers, finance teams managing payroll in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam
**Output**: HR/payroll platform recommendation with implementation plan

## Why HR/Payroll Software Matters in SEA

**Local compliance is mandatory**:
- **Singapore**: CPF (employer + employee contributions), IRAS filing, SDL, FWL
- **Malaysia**: EPF, SOCSO, EIS, PCB, EA forms
- **Indonesia**: BPJS Kesehatan, BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, PPh 21
- **Thailand**: Social Security, PIT, provident fund
- **Philippines**: SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, BIR
- **Vietnam**: Social Insurance, Health Insurance, PIT

**Manual payroll = risk**:
- Late filings → penalties (SGD 1,000+ fines in Singapore)
- Incorrect calculations → employee complaints
- Missing records → audit issues
- Time-consuming (10-20 hours/month for 20 employees)

**Right software = compliance + time savings**:
- Auto-calculate CPF/EPF/BPJS contributions
- Generate government reports (CPF submission, EA forms, etc.)
- E-filing integration (IRAS, MyEPF, etc.)
- Employee self-service (view payslips, apply leave)
- Time tracking and attendance

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Manual Payroll Spreadsheets

**Wrong**: Use Excel to calculate CPF, generate payslips
**Right**: Use payroll software (auto-calculate, e-filing)

**Why**: Manual payroll = 10-20 hours/month, high error rate, no e-filing

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Integrating with Accounting Software

**Wrong**: Export payroll to CSV, manually import to Xero
**Right**: Integrate payroll with Xero/QuickBooks (auto-sync)

**Why**: Manual export/import = 2-4 hours/month, errors

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Employee Self-Service

**Wrong**: HR manually emails payslips, processes leave requests
**Right**: Employees log in to platform (view payslips, apply leave)

**Why**: Self-service saves 5-10 hours/week for HR

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Updating Tax Rates

**Wrong**: Use old CPF rates (miss government changes)
**Right**: Use software that auto-updates tax rates

**Why**: Incorrect rates = penalties, employee complaints

---

## Payroll Calendar (Singapore Example)

**Monthly**:
- **Day 1-5**: Collect attendance, timesheets, leave records
- **Day 5-10**: Process payroll (verify calculations)
- **Day 15**: Pay salaries (bank transfer)
- **Day 15-20**: Submit CPF (via CPF e-submission)
- **Day 20-25**: Generate reports (P&L impact, payroll journal)

**Annually**:
- **January**: Year-end bonuses, AWS (Additional Wage Supplement)
- **March 1**: Submit IR8A to IRAS (annual employee earnings)
- **March-April**: Issue EA forms to employees (Malaysia)

---

## Integration Ecosystem

**Key Integrations** (for all platforms):

| Category | Tools | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
