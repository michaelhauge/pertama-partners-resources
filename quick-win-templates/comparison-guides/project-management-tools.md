# Project Management Tools (Comparison Guide)

**Purpose**: Choose project management software for team collaboration and task tracking
**Time to Complete**: 2-3 hours (research + setup)
**Use Case**: Founders, PMs, engineering leads managing projects and sprints
**Output**: PM tool recommendation with setup plan

---

## Why Project Management Tools Matter

**Without PM tool = chaos**:
- Tasks in Slack, email, spreadsheets (scattered)
- No visibility (who's working on what?)
- Missed deadlines (no tracking)
- Duplicate work (no coordination)

**With PM tool = clarity**:
- Single source of truth (all tasks in one place)
- Visibility (see status at a glance)
- Accountability (assigned owners, due dates)
- Progress tracking (velocity, burndown)

## Platform Comparison

### Quick Selection Guide

| Team Type | Recommended | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Engineering (Agile)** | Linear or Jira | Sprints, velocity, story points |
| **Startup (Simple)** | Asana or Trello | Easy to learn, visual |
| **Design Team** | Notion or ClickUp | Flexible, documents + tasks |
| **Cross-Functional** | Asana or ClickUp | Marketing, sales, support, product |
| **Enterprise** | Jira or Monday.com | Custom workflows, security |

## Implementation Checklist

**Before Setup** (Week 1):
- [ ] Choose platform
- [ ] Sign up for account
- [ ] Decide on workspace structure (projects, teams, boards)
- [ ] Identify admins (who will configure?)

**During Setup** (Week 2):
- [ ] Create projects/boards (1 per team or product)
- [ ] Set up workflows (to-do → in progress → done)
- [ ] Import backlog (if migrating from spreadsheets)
- [ ] Configure automation (auto-assign, notifications)
- [ ] Invite team (send invites, set permissions)

**After Setup** (Week 3-4):
- [ ] Train team (1-2 hours, show workflows)
- [ ] Create first sprint (if agile)
- [ ] Set up integrations (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Review weekly (standup, retrospective)

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Many Projects/Boards

**Wrong**: Create 50 projects (one per small feature)
**Right**: Create 5 projects (one per product or team)

**Why**: Too many projects → fragmented, hard to find tasks

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Using Automation

**Wrong**: Manually assign every task, move every card
**Right**: Auto-assign based on label, auto-move when status changes

**Why**: Automation saves 5-10 hours/week per team

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Over-Customization

**Wrong**: Spend 2 weeks customizing every field, workflow, view
**Right**: Start with defaults, customize only what's broken

**Why**: Over-customization → complexity → team confusion

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Clear Workflows

**Wrong**: Statuses like "To Do", "Doing", "Maybe", "Someday", "On Hold", "Review", "Done"
**Right**: Simple workflow: "To Do" → "In Progress" → "Done"

**Why**: Too many statuses → confusion about what means what

---
