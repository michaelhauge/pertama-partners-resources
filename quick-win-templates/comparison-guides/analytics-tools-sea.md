## Key Events to Track

**For SaaS Products**:

- **Activation**: User completes onboarding (e.g., first project created)
- **Feature Usage**: User uses key features (e.g., exported report, invited team)
- **Upgrade**: User upgrades to paid plan
- **Churn**: User cancels subscription

**For E-Commerce**:
- **Product View**: User views product page
- **Add to Cart**: User adds item to cart
- **Checkout Started**: User begins checkout
- **Purchase**: User completes purchase
- **Repeat Purchase**: User buys again (retention)

**For Mobile Apps**:
- **App Open**: User opens app
- **Screen View**: User views specific screen
- **Feature Usage**: User completes action (e.g., post created, message sent)
- **Push Notification**: User receives/clicks notification
- **In-App Purchase**: User buys premium feature

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Tracking Too Many Events

**Problem**: Tracking 100+ events = noise, hard to find signal
**Solution**: Start with 10-20 key events, add more as needed

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Not Defining Events Upfront

**Problem**: "Let's track everything" → inconsistent naming, hard to analyze
**Solution**: Create event taxonomy (naming convention) before implementing

**Naming Convention**:
Use consistent snake_case format for all events (lowercase with underscores)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: No User Properties

**Problem**: Can't segment users (who's using what?)
**Solution**: Track user properties (plan type, company size, location)

**Example**:
```javascript
mixpanel.identify(userId);
mixpanel.people.set({
  "Plan Type": "Pro",
  "Company Size": "50-100",
  "Country": "Singapore"
});
```

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Reviewing Data Regularly

**Problem**: Set up analytics, never look at it
**Solution**: Weekly review (30 min), monthly deep dive (2 hours)

---

## Multi-Tool Strategy

**Common pattern**: Use 2-3 tools together

**Example 1** (SaaS Startup):
- **GA4**: Marketing analytics (SEO, paid ads, traffic sources)
- **Mixpanel**: Product analytics (feature usage, funnels, retention)
- **Segment**: Data pipeline (route to both GA4 + Mixpanel + data warehouse)

**Cost**: $0 (GA4) + $100 (Mixpanel) + $120 (Segment) = $220/month

---

**Example 2** (E-Commerce):
- **GA4**: Traffic, e-commerce tracking
- **Hotjar**: Heatmaps, session replay (see what users click)
- **Facebook Pixel**: Retargeting ads

**Cost**: $0 (GA4) + $0-80 (Hotjar) + $0 (Facebook Pixel) = $0-80/month

---

**Example 3** (Enterprise SaaS):
- **Amplitude**: Product analytics
- **Segment**: Data pipeline
- **Salesforce**: CRM (customer data)
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse (all data centralized)

**Cost**: $2K (Amplitude) + $1K (Segment) + $1K (Salesforce) + $2K (Snowflake) = $6K/month

---

## Google Sheets Formula Reference

**Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
```
=COUNTUNIQUE(user_id WHERE event_date = TODAY())
```

**Weekly Active Users (WAU)**:
```
=COUNTUNIQUE(user_id WHERE event_date >= TODAY() - 7)
```

**Monthly Active Users (MAU)**:
```
=COUNTUNIQUE(user_id WHERE event_date >= TODAY() - 30)
```

**Retention Rate (Day 7)**:
```
=USERS_WHO_RETURNED_DAY_7 / USERS_WHO_SIGNED_UP
```

**Conversion Rate (Funnel)**:
```
=USERS_WHO_COMPLETED_STEP_2 / USERS_WHO_COMPLETED_STEP_1
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose tool(s)** based on use case (GA4 for marketing, Mixpanel for product)
2. **Sign up for free trial** (test before committing)
3. **Define key events** (10-20 events to track)
4. **Install SDK** (frontend, backend, mobile)
5. **Test tracking** (send test events, verify in dashboard)
6. **Set up dashboards** (key metrics: DAU, WAU, retention, funnels)
7. **Review weekly** (30 min review of key metrics)
